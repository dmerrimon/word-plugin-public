Participants rate their levels of temptation and confidence in each situation on a 5-point Likert scale such as each statement was rated on 5 points as Likert Skill Scale ranged by statistical from (1) No Confidence, (2) Low , (3) Moderate, (4) High, (5) Excellent and composite self-efficacy scores are calculated by subtracting temptation from confidence scores. The scale has demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Spearman-Brown r =.95), and in this study, the adapted translated version for substance abstinence showed high reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.912) validated by the researchers",
