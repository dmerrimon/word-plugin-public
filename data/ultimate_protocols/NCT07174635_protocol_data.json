The FIQR is a revised version of the original FIQ, providing better psychometric properties and more comprehensive coverage of functional domains.The FIQR is a 21-item questionnaire measuring the impact of fibromyalgia across function, overall impact, and symptom domains. Each item is scored from 0 (no impact) to 10 (maximum impact). The total score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse fibromyalgia-related health status. FIQR was administered at baseline and at 2 months post-intervention.\n\nThe FIQR consists of 21 items divided into 3 domains:\n\nFunction domain (9 items) - assesses physical functioning\n\nOverall impact domain (2 items) - measures overall impact of fibromyalgia\n\nSymptom domain (10 items) - evaluates common fibromyalgia symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, sleep quality).",
