Each domain is scored on a scale from 0 to 100, resulting in a total score range of 0 to 500.A decrease of 50 points is considered as a minimal clinically important diference . Te IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QoL) comprises 34 IBS-specifc items which divide into 8 variables: health worries, food avoidance, body image, dysphoria, interference with activity, social reactions, sexual activity, and relationships. Te IBS-QoL score will be transformed into a 0-100 scale using the following formula: (the actual raw score - the lowest possible score)/possible score range\n\n× 100.",
