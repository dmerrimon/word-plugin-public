    "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced (stage IIIB with a malignant pleural effusion or stage IV disease) or recurrent nonsquamous NSCLC\n* Patients must have at least one measurable disease per RECIST criteria; all sites of disease must be assessed within 4 weeks prior to registration\n* Patient must have disease progression after one prior combinational chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy other than pemetrexed or an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (such as erlotinib, gefitinib, or a second generation EGFR TKI); prior monoclonal antibody against EGFR is allowed) for metastatic disease, or relapse while receiving adjuvant therapy, or within 12 months of completing adjuvant therapy\n* All patients will be screened for brain metastasis within 6 weeks prior to registration; patients with treated and stable brain metastases must have been treated with surgery and/or radiation and are asymptomatic and are no longer taking corticosteroids\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =\\< 2 or Karnofsky \\>= 60%\n* Absolute neutrophil count \\>= 1,500/uL\n* Hemoglobin \\>= 8.0 g/dL\n* Platelets \\>= 100,000/uL\n* Total bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), except in known hepatic metastasis, wherein may be =\\< 3.0 X ULN\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase \\[SGOT\\])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase \\[SGPT\\]) =\\< 3.0 x institutional ULN, except in known hepatic metastasis, wherein may be =\\< 5.0 X ULN\n* Creatinine clearance \\>= 45 mL/min for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal\n* Patients must not be pregnant or breastfeeding since there is no information regarding the use of these agents in this population; a negative serum or urine pregnancy test is required within 14 days prior to registration if pre- or perimenopausal (i.e., last menstrual period within one year of registration); both pemetrexed and erlotinib are Class D agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; patients both females and males with reproductive potential (i.e. menopausal for less than 1 year and not surgically sterilized) must practice contraceptive measures throughout the study\n* Patients taking Warfarin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are eligible; patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency should avoid taking NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives for a period of 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of Alimta; if the patient is taking other cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducers or inhibitors, they must be discontinued at least one week prior to starting erlotinib\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had immunotherapy, hormone, chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier\n* Patients who have received pemetrexed or an EGFR TKI (such as erlotinib, gefitinib, or a second generation anti-EGFR TKI) for their metastatic disease should be excluded from this clinical trial; other molecularly targeted agent, including monoclonal antibody or vaccine against EGFR or angiogenesis inhibitor, is allowed\n* Patients may not be receiving any other investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy\n* Patients with uncontrolled brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to erlotinib or pemetrexed or other agents used in the study\n* Patients with gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease, are ineligible\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection (such as bacteremia or active hepatitis), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; therefore, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with erlotinib or pemetrexed or other agents administered during the study; appropriate studies will be undertake in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated",
