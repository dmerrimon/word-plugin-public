        "description": "The key endpoint of interest will be the change in second phase insulin response derived from the Glucose-Potentiated Arginine (GPA) test. The GPA test will measure insulin, which will be a measure of pancreatic endocrine function in response to the injection of arginine. Arginine is a naturally occurring amino acid (substance) in the body. It will be given in the veins to make the pancreas secrete insulin. After the first injection of arginine, a glucose infusion will be started in order to raise the level of sugar in the blood to 230 mg/dl. Once the level is achieved, arginine will be injected again and blood samples are measured. After a 2 hour break, the glucose infusion will be started to achieve a blood sugar of 340 mg/dl and the arginine injection will be repeated. Comparison of responses at baseline and after 6 months of incretin-based therapy (Sitagliptin) or placebo will be performed using statistical methods.",
