    "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Meet the following criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) at Screening:\n\n   1. A memory complaint reported by the participant or their study partner\n   2. A Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0.5 to 1.0 (inclusive) with a memory box score â‰¥ 0.5\n   3. Essentially preserved activities of daily living, in the opinion of the investigator\n   4. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) report, obtained within the 2 years preceding the Baseline Period, that is consistent with the diagnosis of AD with no clinically significant findings of non-AD pathology that could account for the observed cognitive impairment\n2. Have a score of 15 to 25 (inclusive) on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) with years of education adjustment at Screening.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Have participated in a previous clinical study of SAGE-718, have participated in a previous gene therapy study, or have received study treatment in any other drug, biologic, or device trial within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer), unless the participant participated solely in the placebo arm of the study. Additionally, participants who have received treatment with antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) will be excluded\n2. Have a condition that precludes undergoing an MRI, in accordance with standard operating procedures at the imaging facility (eg, ferromagnetic metal in the body, claustrophobia), in a participant requiring MRI during Screening\n3. Have any medical or neurological condition (other than AD) that might be contributing to the participant's cognitive impairment or history of cognitive decline\n4. Have a history, presence, and/or current evidence of\n\n   1. Brain surgery, deep brain stimulation, or any history of hospitalization due to a brain injury\n   2. Possible or probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy, according to the Boston Criteria\n   3. Treatment with an anti-amyloid therapy (including biologics) without subsequent MRI demonstrating the absence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities\n   4. Seizures or epilepsy, with the exception of childhood febrile seizures\n5. Participants has a history of suicidal behavior within 2 years or answers \"YES\" to Questions 3, 4, or 5 on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at Screening or at Day 1 or is currently at risk of suicide in the opinion of the investigator\n6. Have any of the following medical conditions:\n\n   1. Any clinically significant finding on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during Screening in the opinion of the investigator\n   2. Any clinically significant supine vital signs (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) during Screening (note: vital sign measurements may be repeated once)\n7. Have a history, presence, and/or current evidence of serologic positive results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or HIV-2, or hepatitis B or C\n8. Have a positive pregnancy test, or be lactating, or intend to breastfeed during the study\n9. Is known to be allergic to any of SAGE-718 excipients, including soy lecithin",

The participant is required to identify the symbols matched to numbers using a key and write in the symbol beneath the associated number. The total score ranges from 0 to 135 and is based on the total number of codes correctly completed over a 120-second time limit. Higher scores indicate better processing speed. Positive change from baseline indicates better processing speed. Least Squares (LS) Means were calculated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach.",
