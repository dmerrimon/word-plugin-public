In those cases, in absence of an alternative diagnosis, and with highly suspect bilateral ground glass opacities on recent (\\<24h) chest-CT scan (confirmed by a radiologist and pulmonary physician as probable COVID-19), a patient can be enrolled as probable COVID-19 infected. In all cases, this needs confirmation by later seroconversion.\n* Presence of acute hypoxic respiratory failure defined as (either or both)\n\n  * saturation below 93% on minimal 2 l/min O2\n  * PaO2/FiO2 below 300\n* Admitted to specialized COVID-19 ward\n* Age 18-80\n* Male or Female\n* Willing to provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with known history of serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor such as sargramostim, yeast-derived products, or any component of the product.\n* mechanical ventilation before start of study\n* patients with peripheral white blood cell count above 25.000 per microliter and/or active myeloid malignancy\n* patients on high dose systemic steroids (\\> 20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent)\n* patients on lithium carbonate therapy\n* Patients enrolled in another investigational drug study\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding females (all female subjects regardless of childbearing potential status must have negative pregnancy test at screening)\n* Patients with serum ferritin \\>2000 mcg/ml (which will exclude ongoing HLH)",

The HRCT findings are graded on a scale of 1-4 based on the classification system: 1. normal attenuation; 2. reticular abnormality; 3. traction bronchiectasis; and 4. honeycombing. The presence of each of the above four HRCT findings is assessed independently in three (upper, middle and lower) zones of each lung. The extent of each HRCT finding was determined by visually estimating the percentage (to the nearest 5%) of parenchymal involvement in each zone. The score for each zone was calculated by multiplying the percentage of the area by the grading scale score (i.e. 1. normal attenuation; 2. reticular abnormality; 3. traction bronchiectasis; and 4. honeycombing). The six zone scores were averaged to determine the total score for each patient. The score ranges from 100 to 400, higher values represent more fibrosis.",
