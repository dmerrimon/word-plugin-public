The Total Symptom Score is calculated as the mean of Pain items (Items 1-3) as a single score, then a mean of this with items 4-7). Weekly summary scores will be created by averaging the daily scores over the 7 days period prior to each visit. A weekly score will be derived only if 4 or more out of 7 days period have non-missing scores. The weekly summary score will be used in analyses. If no weekly summary score is calculable, the participant will have data considered as missing at that visit. Higher scores represent worse symptom severity. The minimum and maximum of the actual score are (0,7) for Nirogacestat and (0,10) for Placebo. A positive change from Baseline value indicated worsening of symptoms.

The PI or site PI may review and decide if the patient should be excluded from the fluvoxamine arms:\n\n1. Taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or tricyclic antidepressants, unless these are at a low dose such that a study investigator concludes that a clinically significant interaction with fluvoxamine (ie either serotonin syndrome or TCA overdose) is unlikely (examples: participant takes escitalopram but only at 10mg daily; that dose plus 100mg fluvoxamine would be insufficient to cause serotonin syndrome; or, participant takes amitriptyline but only at 25mg nightly; even if fluvoxamine inhibits its metabolism, it would be an insufficient dose to cause QTc prolongation or problematic side effects). Risk Class C, monitor therapy.\n2. Individuals who take alprazolam or diazepam and are unwilling to cut the medication by 20% (rationale: fluvoxamine modestly inhibits the metabolism of these drugs). Risk Class C, monitor therapy\n3. Participants taking theophylline, clozapine, or olanzapine (drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are primarily metabolized by CYP 1A2, which is inhibited by fluvoxamine) will be reviewed with a study investigator and excluded unless the investigator concludes that the risk to the participant is low (this would be unlikely; example: participant takes clozapine only as needed and is willing to avoid it for the 14 days of the study).\n4. Patients will be advised that there is a small risk that the following substances will be affected by fluvoxamine, but that significant effects are not likely at the low dose being used: caffeine, nicotine, melatonin.

Study treatment is expected to begin within ≤168 hours from first symptom onset.\n4. Ability to swallow pills.\n5. Documentation of confirmed active SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by a molecular or non-molecular (\"rapid\") test conducted at any clinic or laboratory that had a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification or its equivalent from a sample collected ≤96 hours prior to study entry.\n6. Was experiencing at least one of the following SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms at the time of enrollment: fever (could be subjective including feeling feverish or having chills) OR signs/symptoms of respiratory illness (including but not limited to upper respiratory congestion, loss of sense of smell or taste, sore throat OR lower respiratory illness - cough, shortness of breath).\n7. Agreed to not participate in another interventional clinical trial for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 during the study period (28 days) unless hospitalized.\n8. Agreed to not obtain investigational medications outside of the molnupiravir study.\n9. Agreed to the sampling detailed in the schedule of evaluations and to comply with study requirements including contraception requirements.\n10. A female participant was eligible to participate if she was not pregnant or breastfeeding and at least one of the following conditions applied:\n\n    * Was not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR\n    * Was a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (a low user dependency method OR a user-dependent method in combination with a barrier method), or was abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long-term and persistent basis), as described in Appendix 2 of the study protocol during the intervention period and for at least 50 days after the last dose of study intervention. The investigator evaluated the potential for contraceptive method failure (ie, noncompliance, recently initiated) in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.\n    * A WOCBP must have had a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 24 hours before the first dose of study intervention.\n    * Additional requirements for pregnancy testing during and after study intervention were provided in the study protocol.\n    * The investigator was responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy.\n    * Contraceptive use by women was to be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.\n    * Given the elevated risk of venous thrombotic events in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (Benson et al, 2020; Spratt et al, 2020), estrogen-containing contraceptives could not be started to fulfill the contraceptive requirement of this study at any time during participant's participation. If contraceptives were interrupted as standard of care management of COVID-19 patients and resumed at a later time point, such as at hospital discharge, then abstinence was practiced for the defined period of back-up contraception per the contraceptive product labeling. After this period, contraceptive use had to adhere to the guidance in Appendix 2 of the study protocol.\n11. Male participants were eligible to participate if they agreed to the following during the intervention period and for at least 100 days after the last dose of study intervention:\n\n    * Refrained from donating sperm\n\nPLUS either:\n\n* Were abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agreed to remain abstinent.\n\nOR\n\n* Had to agree to use contraception unless confirmed to be azoospermic (vasectomized or secondary to medical cause \\[Appendix 2 of the study protocol\\]) as detailed below:\n\n  * Agreed to use a male condom plus partner use of an additional contraceptive method when having penile-vaginal intercourse with a WOCBP who was not pregnant. Note: Men with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner had to agree to remain abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile-vaginal penetration.\n  * Contraceptive use by men was to be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Need for hospitalization or immediate medical attention in the clinical opinion of the study investigator.\n2. Hemoglobin \\<10 g/dL in men and \\<9 g/dL in women.\n3. Platelet count \\<100,000/ µL or received a platelet transfusion within 5 days prior to enrollment.\n4. Was on dialysis or has an estimated glomerular filtration rate \\<30 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2\n5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\>3x upper limit normal (ULN).\n6. History of or current hospitalization for COVID-19. Note: Individuals hospitalized and then discharged, even if only hospitalized for 1 day, were excluded.\n7. History of kidney disease as evidenced by estimated creatinine clearance value \\<30 mL/min.\n8. History of significant liver disease in the opinion of the site investigator or active hepatitis B or active hepatitis C. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that is advanced (CD4\\<200/mm\\^3) and/or on treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues.\n9. Use of therapeutic interventions with possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity within 30 days prior to study entry, (e.g., remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir fixed dose combination, ribavirin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and convalescent plasma), or participation in a clinical trial involving any of these drugs whether for treatment or prophylaxis.\n10. Receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination prior to study entry.\n11. Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of molnupiravir, or its formulation.\n12. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.\n13. History of recent (within the past 3 months) hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident) or major bleed.\n14. Presence of a condition, that in the opinion of the investigator, would place the subject at increased risk from study participation.",

The presence of each of the above four HRCT findings is assessed independently in three (upper, middle and lower) zones of each lung. The extent of each HRCT finding was determined by visually estimating the percentage (to the nearest 5%) of parenchymal involvement in each zone. The score for each zone was calculated by multiplying the percentage of the area by the grading scale score (i.e. 1. normal attenuation; 2. reticular abnormality; 3. traction bronchiectasis; and 4. honeycombing). The six zone scores were averaged to determine the total score for each patient. The score ranges from 100 to 400, higher values represent more fibrosis.",

Response bias scores range between -1 and +1. A higher Response Bias score indicates a stronger bias toward the rich stimulus, and a negative Response Bias indicates a stronger bias toward the lean stimulus. The Change-in-Response-Bias is calculated by subtracting Response Bias in block 1 (trials 0-100) of the task from Response Bias in block 3 (trials 201-300) of the task.

The task consists of three blocks. Behavioral performance focuses on the number of times the participant chose the symbol that was associated more frequently associated with the more desirable outcome. A participant scores 1 if they choose correctly, and 0 if they choose in correctly, and correct choices across all three blocks are added and converted to a percentage relative to the total number of trials in that condition (i.e., gain, loss, or neutral).
