Subjects who were positive for hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), but negative for HBsAg and anti-HBc, were eligible\n* Subjects with HIV infection\n* Subjects with:\n\n  1. Suspected or confirmed current active TB disease or a history of active TB disease\n  2.

Each domain consists of 2 or 3 items. For each question the level of difficulty is scored from 0 (without any difficulty, the best outcome) to 3 (unable to do, the worst outcome). Each category is given a score by taking the maximum score of each question.
