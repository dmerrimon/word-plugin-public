Men who could father a child must agree to use at least one form of birth control during or continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse if receiving topical treatment during the study, and for 2 weeks after stopping topical treatment.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n* Participant is willing to be randomized and able to comply with the protocol\n* Clinician is comfortable with either following patient for up to 5 years without therapy or treating patient for up to 5 years\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Inability to provide informed consent\n* Patients who are receiving any other immunomodulatory investigational agents (replacement doses of steroids for adrenal insufficiency or treatment with prednisone â‰¤5 mg/day is permitted) within the 4 weeks before randomization enrollment, other than investigational antiretroviral agents for HIV, or investigational or approved agents for Hepatitis C.\n* History of anal cancer, penile, vulvar, vaginal or cervical cancer, or signs of these cancers at baseline.\n* Treatment or removal of HSIL less than 6 months prior to randomization.\n* Participant has symptoms related to HSIL and would benefit more from immediate treatment than from entry into the study and potential for randomization to active monitoring arm\n* Current systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy that potentially causes bone marrow suppression that would preclude safe treatment of HSIL\n* Participants who only have a single HSIL lesion that is likely to be removed entirely with the initial screening biopsy\n* Warts so extensive that they preclude the clinician from determining the extent and location of HSIL\n* Participant plans to relocate away from the study site to a location without an ANCHOR study site during study participation",
