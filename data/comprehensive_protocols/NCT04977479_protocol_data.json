Patients without documented hypoxia, hypotension, or evidence of end-organ damage who were treated with epinephrine infusion would be considered as CoFAR Grade 3 reaction and may be eligible per investigator discretion.\n* Must be at least 28 days out from their first dose of the Moderna vaccine or 21 days from their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine before proceeding with the placebo or vaccine challenge in this study.\n* Have a primary care physician or other health care provider who will manage their medical care outside of this study.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nAn individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:\n\n* Experienced a Grade 4 systemic allergic reaction (per CoFAR Grading Scale for Systemic Allergic Reactions Version 3.0) to the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.\n* Known exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and still within the quarantine window.\n* Symptoms consistent with acute COVID-19 infection or known COVID-19 infection (positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \\[RT-PCR\\] or antigen test) and still within the quarantine window\n* Have an acute illness, including body temperature greater than 100.4 degrees F, within 14 days prior to enrollment.\n* History of autoimmune or other disorders requiring systemic immune modulators.\n* Are moderately or severely immunocompromised.\n* History of acute urticaria within 28 days prior to enrollment.\n* Pregnant.\n* Have received any vaccines within 14 days prior to enrollment.\n* Scheduled or planned receipt of approved or experimental vaccine prior to visit 3.\n* Had any allergen immunotherapy administration within 24 hours prior to the first study vaccination or plan to receive within 24 hours after the second study vaccination.\n* Have received a biological therapy within 6 months prior to enrollment.\n* Use of systemic steroids for any reason within 28 days prior to enrollment.\n* Use of zileuton within 14 days prior to enrollment.\n* Use of EUA monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and indevimab, or bamlanivimab, or any other antibody agent for treatment or prevention of COVID-19 within 3 months of randomization.\n* Presence of condition(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator or the referring physician, may put the participant at undue risk or make them unsuitable for participation in the study.",
