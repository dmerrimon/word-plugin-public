Previous surgical treatment for obesity (bariatric surgery, gastric banding, etc.) or any other gastrointestinal surgery that may induce malabsorption, history of bowel resection \\> 20 cm, any malabsorption disorder, severe gastroparesis, any GI procedure for weight loss (including LAPBAND®), as well as clinically significant gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. peptic ulcers, severe GERD ) at Screening.\n2. Use of antacids, anticoagulants, or drugs that directly modify gastrointestinal (GI) motility, including antacid s anticholinergics, anticonvulsants, serotonin type 3 (5HT3) antagonists, dopamine antagonists, opiates; anticoagulation within 2 weeks of screening (But, it is not limited to the above listed drugs.)\n3. Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure \\> 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg at screening independent of subjects being on antihypertensive medication or no t). But, if the results are out of the reference range at the screening visit, they can be tested again on another day. Subjects with uncontrolled hypertension may be rescreened after 3 months, following initiation or adjustment of antihyp ertensive therapy.)",
