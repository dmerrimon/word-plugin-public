Normally, ammonia is processed in the liver, where it is changed into another waste product called urea. Urea is passed from the body in urine.\n\nIf your body cannot process or eliminate ammonia, a lab test of a blood sample shows it has built up in the bloodstream. High ammonia levels in the blood can lead to serious health problems, including hepatic encephalopathy.",
