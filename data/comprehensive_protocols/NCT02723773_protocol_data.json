However, licensed non-replicating vaccines (i.e., inactivated and subunit vaccines, including inactivated and subunit influenza vaccines for seasonal or pandemic flu, with or without adjuvant) may be administered up to 8 days prior to each dose and/or at least 14 days after any dose of study vaccine.\n* History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Additionally, consider allergic reactions to other material or equipment related to study participation (such as materials that may possibly contain latex-gloves, syringes, etc.).
