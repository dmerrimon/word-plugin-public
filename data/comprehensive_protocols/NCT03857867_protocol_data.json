Power spectral density (PSD) was calculated for each frequency band (Delta: 2-4 Hz; Theta: 5-7 Hz; Alpha: 8-12 Hz; Low Beta: 13-16 Hz; Mid Beta: 17-20 Hz; High Beta: 21-30 Hz; Gamma: 31-50 Hz). Relative power (RP) was calculated by taking the sum of each frequency and dividing it by the total power (2-50 Hz) expressed as a percentage. High beta power was the frequency band of interest for analysis.",
