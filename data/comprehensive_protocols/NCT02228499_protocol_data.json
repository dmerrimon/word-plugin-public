We will enroll 200 children in grades 3-8 with asthma (cases) from the ED/IMPACT DC and compare them with a group of 200 children in grades 3-8 without asthma (controls) recruited from the ED. Report cards will be collected between June 2014 and November 1, 2014 or until 200 cases and 200 controls have been recruited, and GPAs will be compared. We expect children with asthma will have lower GPAs . GPAs are unweighted 0-4 scale.",
