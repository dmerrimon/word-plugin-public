Has either suspected or documented diagnosis of abdominal sepsis requiring treatment with parenteral antibiotics and planned or completed surgical (laparotomy or laparoscopy) or interventional radiologic procedures within 24 hours of evaluation by medical personnel. Recommended surgical or interventional radiologic procedures be performed with 12 hours of evaluation by medical personnel.\n2. Initial diagnosis of AKI Stage 2 or 3 according to KDIGO AKI criteria established either upon presentation to medical care in those patients with suspected abdominal sepsis or in those patients in whom the initial diagnosis of AKI is established during the 48 hour period from the suspected diagnosis of abdominal sepsis.\n3. Study medication must be administered within 6 hours of confirmation of onset of Stage 2 or 3 AKI as established at the study site, under the following criteria:\n\n   * After the decision is made by the attending surgeon at the study site for a surgical or interventional radiology procedure for the abdominal infection OR\n   * After confirmed diagnosis of abdominal infection has been established by a surgical or interventional radiology procedure\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Has known prior history of chronic kidney disease (CKD( with a documented estimated GFR (eGFR) \\< 30 mL/min\n\n   â€¢ Exception: Patients with history of CKD but no available prior eGFR who have documented normal kidney size on ultrasound or computed tomography evaluation (performed within 90 days of screening) will be eligible\n2. Patients receiving renal replacment therapy (RRT) for CKD\n3. . Previously diagnosed with documented AKI in the last 30 days\n4. Documented primary glomerular disease or toxic tubulo-interstitial nephritis at the time of AKI diagnosis\n5. Patient is not expected to survive throughout 28 days of study due to significant underlying medical condition\n6.
