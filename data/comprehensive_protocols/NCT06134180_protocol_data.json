COST items are generic enough to be applicable to caregivers to persons PLWD without further modification (e.g., \"I feel financially stressed\"). Caregivers are asked to indicate if each statement applies to them \"Not at all\" (0) to \"Very much\" (4). Higher scores indicate higher levels of financial strain.",

Caregivers are asked the frequency at which they use different strategies to manage challenges, and may respond: Not at all like me (0), Pretty much not like me (1), A little bit not like me (2), A little bit like me (3), Pretty much like much like me (4), or Very much like me (5). Items are added together to create a total score. Scores range from 0 to 140, where higher scores indicate higher levels of resourcefulness.

It demonstrates high reliability (alpha=0.89) and good test-retest reliability (0.73). Participants rate the extent to which they are \"Not confident at all\" (1) to \"Totally confident\" (10).
