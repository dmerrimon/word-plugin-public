Otherwise, participants can still participate in the study on a volunteer basis.\n* To be compensated for participation and be included in the main analysis, participants in study 3 must meet criteria for \"struggling with distress\" (ie, a score on either the depression or anxiety subscale greater than or equal to 3 (range 0-6), as these scores are suggestive of a depressive or anxiety disorder.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Having completed the study in the past\n* Failing both of the attention checks in the baseline measures.\n* Spending less than 3 minutes completing the study introduction and baseline measures (ie, were very likely bots)\n* Indicating, at the end of the study, that one did not complete the study seriously and that one's data should not be included in analyses.",
