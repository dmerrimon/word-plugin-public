ELF score is based on the serum levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), amino-terminal propeptide of type III collagen (PIIINP), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and calculated using the following formula: ELF score= 2.494+0.846 In(CHA)+0.391 In(CPIIINP)+0.391 In(CTIMP-1). The levels of each component were as assessed individually and as part of the calculated ELF score as continuous variables. The normal range in healthy subjects â‰¤20 years of age is 6.9 - 8.8. Correlations between ELF and the degree of liver fibrosis have not been established in patients with Fontan circulation, however, a decrease in ELF score is associated with improved liver health in other disease states.",
