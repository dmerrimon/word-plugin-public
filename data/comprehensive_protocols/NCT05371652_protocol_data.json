WOCBP is defined in Section 12.3. No contraception methods are required for male subjects in this study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nTarget Disease Exclusion:\n\n\\* Subjects has a history of basilar migraine with brain stem aura or hemiplegic migraine\n\nMedical History and Comorbidities:\n\n* History of HIV disease\n* Current evidence of poorly controlled, unstable, or recently diagnosed cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease such as ischemic heart disease, coronary vasospasm, and cerebral ischemia. Myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), cardiac surgery, stroke, or transient ischemic attack (TIA) during 6 months prior to screening\n* Poorly controlled hypertension (high blood pressure) or poorly controlled diabetes (but subjects with stable hypertension and/or diabetes for at least 3 months prior to screening may be included in the study). Blood pressure greater than 150 mmHg systolic or 100 mmHg diastolic after 10 minutes of rest is exclusionary\n* Subjects with a current diagnosis of major depression or a major depressive episode within the last 12 months, other pain syndromes, psychiatric disorders, dementia, or significant neurological disorders (other than migraine) that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with study assessments\n* History of gastric or small intestinal surgery (including gastric bypass, gastric banding, gastric sleeve, gastric water ball, etc.) or diseases resulting in malabsorption\n* Subject has a history or diagnosis of Gilibert's Syndrome or any other active hepatic or biliary disorder\n* History or presence of significant and/or unstable medical conditions (e.g., history of congenital heart disease or cardiac arrhythmia, known suspected infection, hepatitis B or C or neoplasm) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would expose the subjects to undue risk of a significant adverse events (AE) or interfere with the assessment of safety or effectiveness during the trial\n* History or evidence of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 12 months, or treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, or meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) criteria for any significant substance abuse disorder within the past 12 months prior to the Screening Visit\n* Subjects should be excluded if they have a positive drug screen for drugs of abuse and are considered medically significant by the investigator, would compromise subject safety, or interfere with the interpretation of study results. In addition:\n* Subjects with detectable levels of cocaine, amphetamines, and phencyclidine in drug abuse screening need to be excluded.\n\nSubjects who are positive for amphetamines on the urine drug screen may have their urine samples evaluated for further analysis at the investigator's discretion to rule out a false positive result\n\n* Subjects with detectable levels of marijuana during substance abuse screening may not be excluded if they do not meet DSMV criteria for substance abuse or dependence in the subject's opinion as documented by the investigator, and a positive result does not signal a clinical condition that would impact the subject safety or interpretation of the study results\n* Diagnosis of hematologic or solid malignancy within 5 years prior to screening. Subjects with a history of localized basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer may be included in the study if they are cancer-free prior to the screening visit for this study\n* Subjects with a current diagnosis of schizophrenia, major depression requiring treatment with atypical antipsychotics, bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder\n* Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/ m2\n* Subjects with a history of gallstones or cholecystectomy\n* Use of St. John's Wort, products containing St. John's Wort, Coltsfoot root, or extracts within 14 days prior to the baseline visit\n* Use of narcotic drugs such as opioids (e.g., morphine, codeine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone) within 2 days prior to the baseline visit.\n\nAllergy and Adverse Reactions:\n\n\\*. History of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for participation in the study",
