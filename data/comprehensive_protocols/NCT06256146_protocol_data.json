The allergens used will be commercial extracts of the foods (Omega Labs, Toronto, Ontario).\n  * Detection of serum specific IgE (\\>0.35 kU/L) to the culprit food or any of its proteins, measured by fluorescence enzyme immunoassay (Phadia, CAP System, Uppsala, Sweden).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have uncontrolled respiratory disease (asthma, cystic fibrosis, etc.)\n* Patients who present with intercurrent disease active at the time of starting desensitization.\n* Non IgE mediated or non-immunological adverse reactions to milk or peanuts.\n* Malignant or immunopathological diseases and/or severe primary or secondary immune deficiencies.\n* Patients receiving oral immunosuppressor therapy.\n* Patients receiving Î²-blockers (including topical formulations), or who receive daily doses of NSAIDs, aspirin or ACE inhibitors for cardiac issues.\n* Associated diseases contraindicating the use of epinephrine: cardiovascular disease, severe hypertension or hypotension.\n* Patients diagnosed with eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, including patients with a history of antacid use for reflux related to food impaction or with a history of esophageal spasm.\n* Patients already tolerating processed/cooked forms of the food (e.g.,baked goods with milk).",
