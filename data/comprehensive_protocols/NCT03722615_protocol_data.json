Newborns that test positive for CMV at birth will have confirmatory testing done within 3 weeks of birth by testing a repeat saliva and urine sample for CMV DNA by PCR. Confirmed cases will be divided by the total number of newborns screened, stratified by HIV exposure status to determine CMV prevalence.",

        "description": "Screening for sensorineural hearing loss is initially conducted by acoustic reflex testing (ART) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). To pass ART testing, the infant will have to obtain at least two reflexes at either 0.5, 1, 2 and/or 4kHz in both ears. To pass DPOAE testing, the infant will have to pass at least 3 frequencies (2,3,4 and/or 5kHz) in both ears, which is an overall pass. If any of ART or DPOAE has not been passed, the child will have diagnostic visual reinforced audiometry. Hearing thresholds will be defined as: 0 to 20 dB for normal hearing, 21 to 45 dB for mild hearing loss, 46 to 70 dB for moderate hearing loss, and 71 dB or higher for severe hearing loss.",

Composite scores are derived from raw scores for cognitive, language, and motor development and scaled to a metric, with a mean of 100, standard deviation of 15, and range of 40 to 160. Performance that is 2.0 or more standard deviations below the mean score for each group will be used to define neurodevelopmental delay at 6 and 12 months.",

Immune responses to the primary series of PCV will be measured by a standardized enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to test for vaccine serotype-specific capsular immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody concentrations and opsonophagocytic assay.",
