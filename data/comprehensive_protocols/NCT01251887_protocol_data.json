    "criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nSubjects will be overweight, but otherwise healthy, pre-menopausal ambulatory volunteers aged 18 to 50.\n\nTo be eligible for this research study, participants must:\n\n* Be between 18 and 50 years of age.\n* Have regular menstrual cycles.\n* Be willing to use an effective method of birth control such as hormonal contraception, intrauterine device, barrier methods combined with spermicide, or surgical sterilization.\n* Have a body mass index of 25 to 35 kg/m(2).\n* Be otherwise healthy as determined by history, medical examination and laboratory tests.\n* Be able to come to the NIH Clinical Center every weekday for 3 months.\n* Be able to understand the consent form, and provide informed written consent.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nParticipants are not eligible for this research study if they:\n\n* Have been pregnant or have breast fed within the last 2 years.\n* Work, or have an immediate family member who works, with a study investigator. Immediate family is defined as a spouse, parent, child or sibling, whether biological or legally adopted.\n* Are HIV positive.\n* Have any current, unstable medical conditions including respiratory insufficiency requiring oxygen therapy; cardiac ischemia; cardiac or hepatic failure; or acute neurological illness as assessed by history and physical exam.\n* Have evidence of diseases that may influence metabolism (e.g. overt diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, cancer)\n* Have any current or past history of eating disorders such as binge eating or anorexia nervosa.\n* Have had weight loss (bariatric) surgery.\n* Have gained or lost more than 3% of your current weight in the past 3 months.\n* Exercise strenuously, like running, swimming, or basketball, 4 or more times per week.\n* Are planning to begin a strenuous exercise program in the next 4 months.\n* Take supplements that contain omega-6 or omega-3 fatty acids (e.g. fish, cod liver, borage, evening primrose oils)\n* Have significant dietary limitations (e.g. multiple food allergies/intolerances, vegan diet) or special dietary requirements that are difficult to accommodate with study diets\n* Have significant claustrophobia that would preclude study tests.\n* Have a history of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence in the past 5 years.\n* Drink more than 2 alcoholic beverages per day, on average, or 6 drinks per sitting in the past year. Participants may drink up to one alcoholic beverage per day during the study.\n* Used marijuana, amphetamines, cocaine, or heroin even once over the last year. Participants may not use marijuana, amphetamines, cocaine, or heroin during the study.\n* Have smoked 2 or more cigarettes per week, on average, over the past year.\n* Participants may not use tobacco products during the study.\n* Eat fish 3 or more times per week on average.\n* Have a known bleeding disorder.\n* Take medications or supplements that may interfere with this study by altering energy metabolism, nutrient absorption, or food intake. Regular use of the following compounds warrants exclusion: medications for the management of diabetes (Type 1 or 2), typical and atypical antipsychotics, thyroid medications, glucocorticoids, orlistat, decongestants, anti-histamines, and medications for cardiac conditions (e.g. beta blockers), attention disorders (e.g. amphetamine derivatives), blood lipid disorders (e.g. statins, fibrates), and hypertension (e.g. thiazide diuretics), as well as certain anti-depressants (e.g. tricyclics), and supplements that impact energy metabolism, such as ephedrine.\n* Regularly take an anticoagulant medication, such as warfarin or aspirin.\n* Have a pacemaker, brain stimulator, or other implanted electrical device, permanent eyeliner, metallic prosthesis (including metal pins and rods, heart valves, and cochlear implants) that would preclude MRI scans.\n* Are currently participating in any other clinical research studies that include blood draws or other procedures.\n* Have a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level greater than 20 units per liter",
