Pathologic response to therapy was determined at the time of surgery. The tpCR rate is the percentage of participants in the ITT population who achieved a tpCR. Participants with missing data for tpCR (i.e., do not undergo surgery or have an invalid pCR assessment) were included in the analysis and classified as non-responders. Rates of tpCR were calculated in each treatment arm and were assessed using the difference between the Arm B: Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab FDC SC and the Arm A: Pertuzumab IV and Trastuzumab IV tpCR rates and corresponding 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals (CIs). The difference between the tpCR rates along with corresponding 95% Hauck-Anderson CIs were calculated.
