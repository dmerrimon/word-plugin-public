Each of the diabetes behaviors (physical activity, work physical activity, cigarettes, smoking cessation, alcohol consumption, vegetable consumption, fruit consumption, grain consumption, junk food consumption, fast food consumption) had multiple choice answers that were scaled from 1 - n, with n being the number of options. The least healthy choice was assigned \"1\", the most healthy choice was assigned \"n\".

One factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the differences with an a priori level of 0.05.",
