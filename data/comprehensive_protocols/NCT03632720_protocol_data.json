This exception includes monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines and multivalent influenza vaccines.\n* Previous vaccination against meningococcal disease with either the trial vaccine or another vaccine (i.e., mono- or polyvalent, polysaccharide, or conjugate meningococcal vaccine containing serogroups A, C, W, or Y; or meningococcal B serogroup-containing vaccine).\n* Previous vaccination (before Visit 1) with any pneumococcal, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), poliovirus, and/or rotavirus vaccines. Receipt of BCG vaccine at birth was acceptable.\n* Receipt of immune globulins, blood or blood-derived since birth.\n* Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, including Severe Combined Immunodeficiency disorder (SCID); or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy; or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks) since birth.\n* History of any neurologic disorders, including any seizures and progressive neurologic disorders or encephalopathy.\n* History of Neisseria meningitidis infection, confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically.\n* History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, Hib, hepatitis B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and/or rotavirus infection or disease.\n* At high risk for meningococcal infection during the trial (specifically, but not limited to, participants with persistent complement deficiency, with anatomic or functional asplenia, or participants travelling to countries with high endemic or epidemic disease).\n* History of Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n* Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a life-threatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances including neomycin, kanamycin, polymyxin, formaldehyde, and latex.\n* Hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency.\n* History of intussusception or uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose to intussusception.\n* Verbal report of thrombocytopenia, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination in the investigator's opinion.\n* Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination.\n* Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, was at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion.\n* Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives, including planning to leave the area of the study site before the end of the study.\n* Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment), or febrile illness (temperature \\>= 38.0°C), or diarrhea or vomiting on the day of vaccination.
