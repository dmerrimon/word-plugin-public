Documented diagnosis of concurrent inborn errors of metabolism.\n2. Platelet count, lymphocyte count or hemoglobin below the lower limit of normal (LLN) at the Baseline visit.\n3. Hepatic insufficiency with liver enzyme tests (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\] or alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\]) greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at the Baseline Visit.\n4. Bilirubin \\> 1.2 g/dL at the Baseline Visit.\n5. Inability to complete the elements of the study, e.g., coma, hemodynamic instability or requiring continuous ventilator support.\n6. Malabsorption requiring total parenteral nutrition (TPN), chronic diarrhea, bouts of pseudo obstruction.\n7. Severe end-organ hypo-perfusion syndrome secondary to cardiac failure resulting in lactic acidosis.\n8. Patients with suspected elevated intracranial pressure, pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) and/or papilledema.\n9. Severe gastrointestinal disease including gastroparesis.\n10. History of drug or alcohol abuse.\n11. History of pancreatitis.\n12. Participated in an investigational drug trial (except the RP103-MITO-001 study) within 30 days or, within 90 days for a biologic, device, or surgical treatment, for inherited mitochondrial diseases prior to the Baseline Visit.\n13. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to cysteamine and penicillamine.\n14.
