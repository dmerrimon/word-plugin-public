Note: Subjects with a positive drug screen who are taking an allowed, prescribed medication that is known to result in a positive drug test (eg, amphetamine and dextroamphetamine for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, benzodiazepine for anxiety disorder) may be eligible for participation in the study at the discretion of the Sponsor. Subjects taking any marijuana (medical or recreational) are not allowed to participate in the study.\n* Previously participated in an HTX-011 study.\n* Received an investigational product or device in a clinical trial within 30 days or within 5 elimination half-lives.\n* Has undergone 3 or more surgeries within 12 months.\n* Has a body mass index (BMI) \\>39 kg/m2.",
