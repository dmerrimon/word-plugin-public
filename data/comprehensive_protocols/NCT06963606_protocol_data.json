The participants have to meet the following criteria:\n\n1. â‰¥15 years old.\n2. Appearance of tuberculosis-related respiratory symptoms or signs.\n3. Individuals not previous diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis.\n4. Capable of completing pathogen examinations and subsequent related inspections.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\nThose who meet any of the below criteria will be excluded:\n\n1. Previous diagnosed with extrapulmonary tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis infection.\n2. The quality of Chest X-ray images did not meet the standard requirements.\n3. Unrecognized identity information participants.\n\nWithdrawal Criteria In the event of participant withdrawal, study personnel should use methods such as phone communication, as well as scheduling follow-up appointments, to re-establish contact with the participants. The aim is to understand the reasons for withdrawal, diligently record the reasons for withdrawal, and endeavor to complete the study-related research content.\n\n1. Participants who are lost to follow-up or who do not complete the follow-up period.\n2. Participants who experience a sudden and serious illness or choose not to continue participating in the study.",
