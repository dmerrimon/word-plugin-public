        "description": "This outcome represents the change in PET signal intensity in the bilateral paraventricular nucleus before and after minocycline treatment. PET imaging was performed using the radiotracer \\[¹¹C\\]PBR28, which binds to the Translocator Protein (TSPO), a marker of activated microglia and neuroinflammation. To ensure accurate anatomical localization, each participant's PET scan was co-registered with a high-resolution T1-weighted MRI. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn on the MRI and applied to the PET images to extract PET signal from the same brain structures. The signal was quantified as non-displaceable binding potential (BP\\_ND). The change in signal is calculated as the average change in BP\\_ND at baseline minus the average change in BP\\_ND after treatment. A positive value indicates that the PET signal decreased following treatment, reflecting a reduction in microglial activation and suggesting a favorable anti-inflammatory response to minocycline.",
