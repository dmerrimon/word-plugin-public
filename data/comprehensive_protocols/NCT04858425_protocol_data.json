Part 2 only, patients with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19, with or without pneumonia.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. At the time of randomization, patients who require intensive care unit (ICU) admission or patients with severe respiratory insufficiency who require mechanical ventilation or with rapid worsening of respiratory function leading to expectation for mechanical ventilation or ICU admission.\n2. Evidence of rapid clinical deterioration or existence of any life-threatening co-morbidity or any other medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the patient unsuitable for inclusion.\n3.
