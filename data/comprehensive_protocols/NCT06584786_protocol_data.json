This test consists of eight items designed to evaluate COPD symptoms. These symptoms include cough, phlegm production, chest tightness, breathlessness, limitations in daily activities, confidence in leaving the house, sleep disturbances, and energy levels. Each symptom is rated on a scale from 0 to 5, culminating in a total CAT score ranging from 0 to 40. A higher score reflects more severe COPD symptoms. A score of 10 or higher is indicative of a significant symptom burden.",
