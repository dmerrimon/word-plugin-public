Deficits of attention are related to fall risk and may be affected by donepezil.\n\nThe delta of the Orienting Network Efficiency is reported for each phase (pre- and post-donepezil phase and pre- and post-placebo phase).\n\nDetails: In accordance with Fan et al. (2002), the subtraction method was applied to isolate the efficiency of the three attentional networks as follows: for the alerting network efficiency: mean RT NC trials - mean RT DC trials; for the orienting network efficiency: mean RT CC trials - mean RT SC trials; and for the executive network efficiency: mean RT I trials - mean RT C trials. For both the alerting and orienting effects, higher subtraction scores indicate greater efficiency; by contrast, the more efficient the executive network is, the lower the subtraction score.",
