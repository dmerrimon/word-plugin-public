In female patients of child-bearing potential, those willing to use effective and reliable contraception for the duration of the study will be eligible.\n\nFailure of a first-line regimen is defined as a viral load (VL) of \\>1000 copies/mL (within the previous two months) and an immediately prior VL \\>1000 copies/mL, taken 2-24 months prior (based on data captured by National Health Laboratory Service).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* If the patient has two VLs 2-3 months apart: \\>2 log drop in VLs between the most recent VL (within the previous two months) and the immediately prior VL (taken 2-3 months prior)\n* CD4 count \\<100 cells/microlitre\n* Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \\<50 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula\n* Alanine aminotransferase \\>100 U/L or total bilirubin \\>twice the upper limit of normal\n* Pregnant or desire to become pregnant during the study period (48 weeks)\n* Breastfeeding\n* Being treated for active tuberculosis (TB) or concern that patient has undiagnosed active TB (based on symptom screening) as rifampicin reduces the concentrations of dolutegravir and thus requires dose adjustments\n* Any current diagnosis of malignancy\n* Allergy or intolerance to one of the drugs in regimen\n* Active, severe psychiatric disease judged likely to impact adherence\n* Current substance abuse judged likely to impact adherence\n* On treatment for AIDS-defining condition (not including secondary prophylaxis maintenance therapy)\n* Any other clinical condition that in the opinion of an investigator puts the patient at increased risk if participating in the study",
