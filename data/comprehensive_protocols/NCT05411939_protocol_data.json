This will be assessed using a survey with a 5-point scale that asks several questions about a patient's willingness to pursue specific treatment options (1 = not at all willing, 5 = completely willing). The change over time is assessed to see if the intervention changes the patient's willingness to consider different treatment options. To assess change a baseline survey, a survey immediately after the intervention, and survey 4 weeks later will be collected.
