If they are on medication for a condition, the medication dose must have been stable for at least 3 months preceding vaccination).\n4. Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or postmenopausal for greater than or equal to one year) and men must agree to practice adequate contraception (barrier or hormone methods or intra uterine device (IUD) for women and a condom for men) throughout the study treatment and for at least up to day 51 (for female) and day 111 (for male) of the trial (i.e. 30 (for female) and 90 (for male) days after the last dose of the IMP)\n5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to study vaccination.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. History of neurological symptoms or signs, or anaphylactic shock following administration of any vaccine.\n2. Known or suspected (or have a high risk of developing) impairment/alteration of immune function (excluding that normally associated with advanced age).\n3. Receipt of: a) Immunosuppressive drugs: i) systemic glucocorticoids \\>/= 10 mg prednisone per day ii) cytotoxic drugs b) Investigational drugs within 30 days before, or planned during, the study c) Blood products within 3 months before, or planned during, the study d) Influenza vaccine within 6 months before the study) Other vaccines within 30 days before, or planned during, the study\n4. Any serious disease such as: cancer, autoimmune disease, advanced arteriosclerotic disease or complicated diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that requires oxygen therapy, acute or progressive hepatic disease, acute or progressive renal disease, or congestive heart failure, as judged by the PI.\n5.
