Participants who discontinued for transplantation (heart transplantation and combined heart and liver transplantation) or for implantation of a cardiac mechanical assist device, were handled in the same manner as death.

Two summary scores were also calculated: Clinical Summary (calculated as mean of Physical limitation and Total symptom scores) and Overall Summary (calculated as mean of Physical limitation, Social limitation, Total symptoms, and Quality of life scores).
