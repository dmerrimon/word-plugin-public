PCR-confirmed influenza based on nasopharyngeal swab (NS), bronchial aspirate (BA) or broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) within 7 days before ICU admission or within 48 hours after ICU admission. If PCR is not available a positive result of a rapid test is required (a negative rapid test does not imply absence of influenza and thus requires confirmation by PCR)\n4. Influenza symptoms present for no more than 10 days before ICU admission\n5. Respiratory distress as the main reason for ICU admission. Respiratory distress will be defined as tachypnea with an respiratory rate ≥ 25x/min and a paO2/fiO2-ratio (fraction of inspired oxygen) ≤ 300 with or without (bilateral) infiltrates.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients with age \\< 18 years\n2. Pregnant women (based on a positive serum sample)\n3. Expected survival on ICU admission ≤ 48h\n4. Patients having influenza symptoms for more than 10 days before ICU admission\n5. Patients being transferred from another hospital ward or another hospital who already have mycological evidence for an IAA-infection (based on sputum, BA or BAL culture, BAL or serum GM)\n6. Patients with known intolerance or hypersensitivity to posaconazole or other azole antifungal agents\n7. Patients that are being treated actively with antifungal agents for invasive aspergillosis\n8. Patients with a QTc (corrected QT interval) interval ≥500 msec\n9. Patients with liver cirrhosis (Child C)\n10. Participation in another interventional clinical trial -",
