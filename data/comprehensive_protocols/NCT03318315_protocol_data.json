Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study visits.\n3. Are males or non-pregnant females, 19 -64 years of age, inclusive.\n4. Are in good health. - As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations. Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no hospitalizations, Emergency Room (ER), or urgent care for condition and no adverse symptoms that need medical intervention such as medication change/supplemental oxygen). This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a medication change, and there is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the exception of inhaled corticosteroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria), herbals, vitamins, and supplements are permitted.\n5. Oral temperature is less than 100.0°F.\n6. Pulse is 47 to 100 beats per minute (bpm), inclusive.\n7. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 mmHg, inclusive (subjects \\<65 years of age), 85 to 160 mmHg, inclusive (subjects = / \\> 65 years of age).\n8. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mmHg, inclusive.\n9. ESR is less than 30 mm per hour.\n10. Women of childbearing potential must use an acceptable contraception method from 30 days before first study vaccination until 60 days after last study vaccination.\n\n    \\- Not sterilized via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, salpingectomy, hysterectomy, or successful Essure® placement (permanent, non-surgical, non-hormonal sterilization) with documented radiological confirmation test at least 90 days after the procedure, and still menstruating or \\<1 year of the last menses if menopausal.\n\n    \\-- Includes non-male sexual relationships, abstinence from sexual intercourse with a male partner, monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner who has been vasectomized for 180 days or more prior to the subject receiving the first study vaccination, barrier methods such as condoms or diaphragms with spermicide or foam, effective intrauterine devices, NuvaRing®, and licensed hormonal methods such as implants, injectables, or oral contraceptives (\"the pill\").\n11. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to study vaccination.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Have an acute illness, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, within 72 hours prior to study vaccination.\n\n   \\- An acute illness which is nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms remaining is allowable if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, the residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to assess safety parameters as required by the protocol.\n2. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, is a contraindication to study participation.\n\n   \\- Including acute or chronic medical disease or condition, defined as persisting for at least 90 days, that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of responses or the subject's successful completion of this trial.\n3. Have immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment, a recent history or current use of immunosuppressive or immunomodulating disease therapy.\n4. Use of anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy (cytotoxic) within 3 years prior to study vaccination.\n5. Have known active neoplastic disease or a history of any hematologic malignancy. Non-melanoma, treated, skin cancers are permitted.\n6. Have known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection.\n7. Have known hypersensitivity or allergy to eggs, egg or chicken protein, squalene-based adjuvants, or other components of the study vaccine.\n8.
