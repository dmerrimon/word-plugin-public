These include the following groups: Immunocompromised, Hemodynamically significant cardiac disease {e.g. congenital heart disease}, Lung disease with chronic respiratory failure, Medically complex children defined as children who have a long-term dependence on technological support (including tracheotomy) associated with developmental delay and/or genetic anomalies21, Obesity, Infant, i.e. child â‰¤1 year old.\n* Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection OR high-risk exposure as defined:\n\n  1. Confirmed infection: Child who tested positive for COVID-19 and is no more than 168 hours after onset of symptoms (and within 192 hours at the time of receipt of plasma).\n  2. High-risk exposure: Susceptible child who was not previously infected or otherwise immune to SARS-CoV-2 and exposed within 96 hours prior to enrollment (and within 120 hours at the time of receipt of plasma). Both criteria below should be met: A household member or daycare center (same room) exposure to a person with \\[confirmed SARS-CoV-2 OR with clinically compatible disease in regions with widespread ongoing transmission\\] and a negative for SARS-CoV-2 (nasopharyngeal swab)\n* Subject is judged by the investigator to have the initiative and means to be compliant with the protocol.\n* Subjects or their legal representatives must have the ability to read, understand, and provide written informed consent for the initiation of any study related procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of severe reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis) to transfusion of blood products. Subjects with minor reactions such as fever, itching, chills, etc. that resolve spontaneously or respond to pre-medications, and that do not represent more significant allergic reactions will not be excluded.\n* Inability to complete therapy with the study product within the stipulated time frame outlined above\n* Female subjects in child-bearing age with a positive pregnancy test, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant/breastfeed during the study period.\n* Subject / caregiver deemed by the study team to be non-compliant with the study protocol",
