Patient suffering from an epileptic syndrome that is known to be refractory to treatment, such as Dravet or Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, may be included after a trial of only two drugs, and\n* Between 1-4 baseline anti-epileptic drugs at stable doses for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to submitting records for review by the CBD Treatment Approval Committee.\n* VNS or RNS must be on stable settings for a minimum of 3 months.\n* If on ketogenic diet, must be on stable ration for a minimum of 3 months.\n* Review of the following patient medical information:\n\n  * Most recent Brain MRI report,\n  * Most recent ECG report,\n  * Video/EEG monitoring report confirming the diagnosis of epilepsy,\n  * Evidence that the patient has failed 4 AEDs as indicated above,\n  * Patient must have at least 4 clinically countable seizures per month,\n  * Seizure history to include a documented history of generalized (drop, atonic, tonic clonic, and/or myoclonic) seizures, focal seizures without loss of consciousness with a motor component, focal seizures with loss of consciousness, or focal seizures with secondary generalization, complex partial seizures with a motor or tonic component, and I or altered awareness seizures,\n  * Results of routine testing including blood work (Complete Blood Count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), Liver Function Tests (LFTs), renal panel, Urinary Analysis (UA), and levels of all AEDs) and digital copy of a routine EEG along with the formal written report performed within 3 months prior to submitting records for CBD Treatment Approval review. If applicable, results of any metabolic or genetic testing performed should be included in submitted records for review. If any AED dose was adjusted in the preceding 3 months, level on the new dose will need to be provided.\n  * If applicable, documentation (including date of surgery) of prior VNS, RNS, Corpus Callosotomy, or other epilepsy surgery the patient has received.\n* Acceptable method of contraception (or abstinence) for women of childbearing potential and for male patients with partners of childbearing potential, and female patients must have a negative urine pregnancy test on the day of initiating CBD.\n* For patients who agree to participate in the optional neuroimaging sub-study, an MRI screen will be obtained to show that the patient does not have contraindication to receiving MRI/functional MRI (fMRI) at 3 Tesla (e.g., metallic artifact).\n* Patients are able to supply investigator with seizure calendars for the past 3 months prior to submitting records for CBD Treatment Approval Committee review. The patient will need to provide an updated calendar at the time of enrollment.\n* Approval for inclusion by the CBD Treatment Approval Committee.\n* Current State of Alabama Resident\n* Acceptable documentation of Alabama residency includes the following:\n\n  * a state issued identification (ID), such as a driver's license, from patient or patient's parent/ legally authorized representative (LAR).\n  * documents showing the patient or patient's parent/LAR rents/owns property in the state,\n  * state voter registration from patient or patient's parent/LAR, or\n  * a recent state tax return from patient or patient's parent/LAR.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Active Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES); Patients with more than 1 year freedom from PNES will not be excluded,\n* Patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or not using acceptable methods of contraception during the course of the study and for three months thereafter,\n* Male patient's partner is of child bearing potential; unless willing to ensure that they (male patients) or their partner(s) are using acceptable methods of contraception during the course of the study and for three months thereafter\n* History of substance abuse/addiction,\n* Use of medical marijuana or CBD based product in the past 30 days,\n* Initiation of felbamate within last 12 months,\n* Allergy to CBD or any marijuana-type products,\n* Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) \\>5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) or Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) \\>5 x ULN, as seen in participant's laboratory results submitted to the CBD Treatment Approval Committee for review.\n* Hemoglobin \\<10 or Hematocrit \\<30 or White Blood Cell (WBC) \\< 2000, as seen in participant's laboratory results submitted to the CBD Treatment Approval Committee for review.\n* In Investigator's judgement, active medical condition/treatment that impacts study activities.\n* Unable to provide consent (and no LAR),\n* Unable/Failure to comply with study visits/requirements and/or instructions.\n* Confirmed diagnosis for Dravet Syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome that qualifies the patient for a Greenwich (GW) Dravet Syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome randomized controlled clinical trial for which the patient is eligible pursuant to the GW clinical trial enrollment criteria unless\n\n  * (a) there is no study that is either actively open for enrollment of patients at The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) or that is expected to actively begin enrolling patients at UAB within two (2) months of the date on which the patient is screened for the UAB Pediatric CBD Program or UAB Adult CBD Program. Primary residence in a State different than Alabama.\n* Subjects with contraindications to MRI/fMRI at 3 Tesla (e.g., metallic artifact) will not be offered participation in the optional sub-study.",

The CSSS measured components of seizures most disturbing or disruptive to the participants. The total scores for a given seizure type was its severity score. High scores indicated high severity of the seizures (no fixed maximum value), while a score of zero indicated low severity. Scores were recorded and stored in the UAB RedCap System. The analysis plan was to assess the pattern of change in seizure severity scores over time, relative to baseline, following CBD exposure.
