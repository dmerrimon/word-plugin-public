CM is defined as greater than or equal to 15 headache days per month of which greater than or equal to 8 headache days on average across the 3 months meet criteria as migraine days\n  2. EM is defined as less than 15 headache days per month of which at least 4 or more headache days on average across the 3 months meet criteria as migraine days\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects greater than 50 years of age at migraine onset.\n* History of cluster headache or hemiplegic migraine headache.\n* Unable to differentiate migraine from other headaches.\n* Migraine with continuous pain, in which the subject does not experience any pain-free periods (of any duration) during the 1 month before the screening period.\n* Malignancy, except non-melanoma skin cancers, cervical or breast ductal carcinoma in situ within the last 5 years.\n\nOther exclusion criteria may apply",
