        "description": "Cancellous bone formation rate at month 3 is calculated from the cancellous (trabecular) compartment of the iliac crest bone biopsy specimens.\n\nBone formation rate (BFR/BS, mm3/mm2/day): amount of new bone formed in unit time per unit of bone surface. It is calculated by multiplying the mineralizing surface/bone surface (MS/BS) by the mineral apposition rate (MAR) - see below for how MS/BS and MAR are calculated.\n\nMineralizing surface (MS/BS, %): is the percent of bone surface that displays a tetracycline label reflecting active mineralization. It is calculated as the double-labeled surface plus one half of the single-labeled surface and is expressed as a function of total bone surface. It is a measure of the proportion of bone surface upon which new mineralized bone was being deposited during the period of tetracycline labeling.\n\nMineral apposition rate (MAR mm/day): is the mean distance between the double labels, divided by the time interval between them.",
