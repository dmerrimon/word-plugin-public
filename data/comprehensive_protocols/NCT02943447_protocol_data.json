In adults with Gilbert's syndrome or hemolysis, FibroSURE/FibroTest will be calculated using direct bilirubin instead of total bilirubin.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\> 5 x ULN\n* Total bilirubin \\> 2 x ULN\n* International normalized ratio (INR) \\> 1.2 unless on anticoagulant therapy\n* Other causes of liver disease including viral, metabolic, alcoholic, and other autoimmune conditions. Participants with hepatic steatosis may be included if there is no evidence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in the opinion of the investigator or on liver biopsy.\n* Use of fibrates or obeticholic acid within 3 months prior to screening through the end of treatment\n* Cirrhosis of the liver as defined by any of the following:\n\n  * Historical liver biopsy demonstrating cirrhosis (eg, Ludwig stage 4 or Ishak stage ≥ 5)\n  * History of decompensated liver disease, including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy or variceal bleeding\n  * Liver stiffness \\> 16.9 kPa by FibroScan®\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.",
