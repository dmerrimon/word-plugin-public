Biopsy, diagnostic tonsillectomy, airway tumor debulking or excisional lymph node biopsy do not constitute major surgery.\n* Active infection requiring antibiotics or antifungals within 7 days prior to first dose of study drug.\n* Significant electrolyte imbalance prior to enrollment (note that patients may be supplemented to achieve acceptable electrolyte values):\n\n  * Hypomagnesemia \\<1.2 mg/dL or 0.5 mmol/L.\n  * Hypokalemia \\< 3.0 mmol/L.\n* Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.",
