If currently treated: The subject has a documented historical diagnosis of hypertension AND a post-washout clinic Seated Diastolic BP meeting the above criteria on Day -1 (or Day 1 for subjects not participating in Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring)\n  2. If currently untreated: The subject has elevated Seated Diastolic BP meeting the above criteria on 3 separate occasions before Randomization, including on Day -1 (or Day 1 for subjects not participating in Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring)\n* The subject is male or female and aged 6 to \\<18 years at Baseline and weighs at least 25 kg\n* The subject agrees to continue their previously implemented nonpharmacological life style modifications if begun prior to Screening. Note: For subjects participating in a weight loss program, the weight maintenance\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* The subject has a clinic Seated Diastolic BP greater than 15 mm Hg and/or Seated Diastolic BP greater than 10 mm Hg above the 99th percentile for age, gender, and height as confirmed by the average (arithmetic mean) of 3 serial clinic seated BP measurements at Screening/Visit 1\n* The subject has a diagnosis of malignant or accelerated hypertension\n* The subject is currently treated with more than 2 antihypertensive agents\n* The subject or parent/legal guardian is not willing for the subject's previous antihypertensive medications to be stopped\n* The subject has participated in the intensive, active weight-loss phase of a weight-loss program within 30 days prior to Screening/Visit 1\n* The subject has any of the following: severe renal impairment (eGFR \\<30 mL/min/1.73 m2 by the Schwartz formula); is currently undergoing dialysis treatment; renovascular disease affecting both kidneys or a solitary kidney; severe nephrotic syndrome not in remission; or serum albumin \\<2.5 g/dL\n* The subject has a history or clinical manifestations of severe cardiovascular, hepato-biliary, gastrointestinal, endocrine-metabolic (e.g., hyperthyroidism, Cushing's syndrome), hematologic, immunologic, genito-urinary, or psychiatric disease, cancer, and/or any conditions that would interfere with the health status of the subject through study participation, or would jeopardize study integrity in the opinion of the investigator\n* The subject is suffering from uncorrected coarctation of the aorta, or hemodynamically significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction due to eg, aortic valvular disease, or is likely to undergo a procedure known to affect blood pressure (eg, repair of arterial anomalies) during the course of the study\n* The subject is poorly controlled diabetic defined as having a glycosylated hemoglobin value \\>8.5% at Screening/Visit 1\n* The subject has hyperkalemia as defined by the central laboratory's normal reference range or any pertinent electrolyte disorders at Screening/Visit",
