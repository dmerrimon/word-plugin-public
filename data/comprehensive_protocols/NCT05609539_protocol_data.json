Successful access to the arterial system using a remote site; 2. successful deployment of the endoluminal graft with secure proximal and distal fixation; 3. absence of either a type I or III endoleak; 4. patent endoluminal graft without significant twist, kinks, or obstruction by intraoperative measurements; 5 patency of both renal arteries and at least one hypogastric artery.",
