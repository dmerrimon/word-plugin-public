This was measured using cardiopulmonary exercise tress test (CPET), recorded in milliliters per kilogram per minute (mL/kg/min). Higher oxygen consumption scores indicate better aerobic capacity and cardiovascular function. An increase in oxygen consumption from baseline to post-intervention signifies an improvement in these areas. Conversely, a decrease would indicate a decline in aerobic capacity and cardiovascular health.",
