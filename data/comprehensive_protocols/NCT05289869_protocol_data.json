Cervical dilation ≤4 cm at time of initiation of induction\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Fetal demise\n2. Major fetal congenital malformation or known chromosomal abnormality\n3. Prior uterine surgery (e.g., cesarean, myomectomy)\n4. Non-reassuring fetal wellbeing as indication for induction\n5. Intraamniotic infection suspected or diagnosed prior to randomization\n6.

Initiation of oxytocin in the second stage of labor\n12. Use of oxytocin prior to randomization or planned use of oxytocin with foley catheter for cervical ripening\n13. Fetal malpresentation\n14.
