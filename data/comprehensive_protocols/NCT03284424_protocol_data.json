If a participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment.)\n\n* Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment.\n* Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.\n* Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (e.g. with use of disease-modifying agents, anticoagulants, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs).\n* Has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n* Has a known history of Hepatitis B or known active Hepatitis C virus infection.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.",
