Subject has at least 1 year history of migraine (with or without aura) consistent with a diagnosis according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition, including the following:\n\n   1. Age of onset of migraines prior to 50 years of age\n   2. Migraine attacks, on average, lasting 4 - 72 hours if untreated\n   3.
