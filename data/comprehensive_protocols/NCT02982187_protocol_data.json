Subjects must be able to continue using their currently prescribed COPD maintenance inhaler therapy throughout the study and as needed short acting beta-adrenergic agonist (SABA) and/or short acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) for rescue use.\n* Has been on current maintenance ICS/LABA COPD treatment for at least 4 weeks prior to V0 and evaluated as unlikely to change treatment within 4 weeks of Visit 1.\n* Current or former (defined as subjects who have quit smoking for at least 3 months prior to V0/V1) cigarette smokers with a \\>10 pack-year smoking history (Number of pack years=\\[number of cigarettes per day ÷ 20\\] x number of years smoked \\[e.g., 10 pack-years is equal to 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years\\]).\n* Males or females who are not pregnant or not planning a pregnancy during the study or not lactating\n* Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this protocol.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. Subjects with a prior history of asthma are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD.\n* Subjects who used any ELLIPTA inhaler (participated in a clinical study of GW685698, GW642444, GSK573719 \\[fluticasone furoate, vilanterol, umeclidinium bromide\\], or any combination thereof, or placebo in an ELLIPTA inhaler study) within 24 months prior to Visit 0.\n* Subjects who used any capsule system inhaler (e.g. Spiriva HANDIHALER, SEEBRI®/ULTIBRO® BREEZHALER®, or participated in a clinical studies of these, including placebo inhalers) within 24 months prior to Visit 0. SEEBRI, ULTIBRO, and BREEZHALER are registered trademarks of Novartis AG.\n* Dependent on which sub-study a subject is included on they should not have any recent experience, within 24 months of V 0 of the following inhaler for the sub study included on: Sub Study 1: DISKUS inhaler (e.g., Seretide DISKUS or placebo DISKUS) and Sub Study 2:TURBUHALER (e.g. Symbicort TURBUHALER or placebo TURBUHALER)\n* Subjects with a known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse at Visit 1 which in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the subject's proper completion of the protocol requirement\n* A history of hypersensitivity to any components of the study inhaler (e.g., lactose, magnesium stearate). In addition, subjects with a history of severe milk protein allergy that, in the opinion of the study physician, contraindicates participation will also be excluded.\n* Subjects who have received an investigational drug and/or medical device within 30 days of entry into this study (Screening/Visit 1), or within five drug half-lives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer\n* In the opinion of the investigator, any subject who is unable to read and/or would not be able to complete a questionnaire and understand verbal instructions.",
