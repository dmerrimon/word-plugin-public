If a patient meets criteria 1 and 2, or criteria 1, 3, 4, and 5, a diagnosis of KOA is confirmed.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients will be excluded if they meet any of the following:\n\n* diagnosed with conditions leading to skeletal disorders, such as tuberculosis, tumors or rheumatism of the knee joint and rheumatoid arthritis;\n* present sprain or trauma in the lower limb;\n* unable to walk properly due to foot deformity or pain;\n* present with mental disorders;\n* present with comorbidities including severe cardiovascular disease, liver or kidney impairment, immunodeficiency, diabetes mellitus, blood disorder or skin disease;\n* females who are pregnant or lactating;\n* using physiotherapy treatments for osteoarthritis knee pain;\n* have used intra-articular injection of glucocorticoid or viscosupplementation in the past six months;\n* received knee-replacement surgery;\n* diagnosed with severe (stage 4, according to Kellgren and Lawrence radiographic classification) or late clinical stage of KOA;\n* have a swollen knee or positive result of floating patella test; or'\n* are participating or have participated in the other clinical trials.",
