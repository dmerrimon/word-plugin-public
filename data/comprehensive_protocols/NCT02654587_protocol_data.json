Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions, or laboratory abnormalities that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator and/or sponsor, excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, and which would, therefore, make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study\n16. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of the trial and for at least 90 days after completion of treatment\n17. Male patients sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of the trial and for at least 90 days after completion of treatment.
