The frequency is assessed for the 15 sleep problems based on a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 0 \\[never\\] to 4 \\[very often\\] with the exception of Question 1 score ranging from 0 \\[very often\\] to 4 \\[never\\]). Scores are calculated for each of the 3 domains as well as a total score. The PDSS-2 domain scores range from 0 to 20 and the total score is a sum of the 3 domains and ranges from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate higher frequency and more severe impact of PD on sleep. Negative changes indicate improvement from Baseline.",

Higher scores are consistently associated with more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremors and stiffness. The results can be presented in either domain scores or as a summary index score.

Each dimension comprises 5 levels with corresponding numeric scores, where 1 indicates no problems, and 5 indicates extreme problems. The health status is converted to an index value using the country-specific weighted scoring algorithm for the United States (US).
