PP Set for Efficacy included all enrolled participants who received planned doses of study drug per schedule, complied with the 2nd injection timing, had no major protocol deviations that impacted key or critical efficacy data, and had a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and negative serology test based on bAb specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein at baseline.",

The investigator assessed causality (that is, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the death). The relationship was characterized using the following classifications: Not related: There was not a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the study drug. The temporal sequence of the death relative to administration of the study drug was not reasonable AND/OR the death was more likely explained by a cause other than the study drug. Related: There was a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the study drug. There was evidence of exposure to the study drug. The temporal sequence of the death relative to the administration of the study drug was reasonable. The death was more likely explained by the study drug than by another cause.",
