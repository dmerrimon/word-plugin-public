The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n  * Patients with vitiligo or alopecia\n  * Patients with hypothyroidism (e.g., following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone replacement\n  * Any chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy\n  * Patients without active disease in the last 5 years may be included but only after consultation with the study physician\n  * Patients with celiac disease controlled by diet alone\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring adverse events (AEs) or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent\n* History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis\n* History of active primary immunodeficiency\n* Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis (TB) testing in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B virus \\[HBV\\] surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] result), hepatitis C. Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody \\[anti-HBc\\] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus \\[HCV\\]) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA)\n* Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of durvalumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n  * Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra articular injection)\n  * Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed \\<\\<10 mg/day\\>\\> of prednisone or its equivalent\n  * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., computed tomography \\[CT\\] scan premedication)\n* Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of investigational product (IP). Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to 30 days after the last dose of IP\n* Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy\n* Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug excipients",
