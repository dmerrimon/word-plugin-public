For younger children (5 - 7 years), a simplified 3-point Likert scale, anchored with a happy and a sad face, was used (0=not at all a problem; 2=sometimes a problem; 4=a lot of a problem). PedsQL yields a total QoL score and 2 summary scores: Physical Health Summary Score and Psychosocial Health Summary Score. To obtain scores, items were reverse scored, transformed to a 0 through 100 scale (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0), and averaged; total scores near 0 indicated lower QoL, while scores approaching 100 indicated higher QoL.
