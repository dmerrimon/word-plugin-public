Has laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other commercial or public health assay in any respiratory specimen or saliva, as documented by either of the following:\n\n   * PCR or other assay positive in sample collected \\< 72 hours prior to randomization; OR\n   * PCR or other assay positive in sample collected \\>/= 72 hours but \\< 7 days prior to randomization AND progressive disease suggestive of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n   Note: if written documentation of the positive test result is not available at enrollment (e.g., report from other institution), the subject may be enrolled but the PCR should be repeated at the time of enrollment.\n6. Illness of any duration, and at least one of the following:\n\n   * Radiographic infiltrates by imaging (chest x-ray, CT scan, etc.), OR\n   * SpO2 \\< / = 94% on room air, OR\n   * Requiring supplemental oxygen.\n7.

Agrees to not participate in another clinical trial (both pharmacologic and other types of interventions) for the treatment of COVID-19 through Day 29.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Anticipated discharge from the hospital or transfer to another hospital which is not a study site within 72 hours.\n2. Subject meets criteria for ordinal scale category 6 or 7 at the time of screening.\n3. Subject has a positive test for influenza virus during this current hospital admission.\n4. Subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \\< 30 mL/min are excluded unless in the opinion of the PI, the potential benefit of receiving remdesivir outweighs the potential risk of study participation.\n5. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \\> 5 times the upper limits of normal.\n6. Total white cell blood cell count (WBC) \\<1500 cells/microliter.\n7.

Allergy to any study medication including history of hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or human albumin.\n11. Patient has a chronic or acute medical condition or is taking a medication that cannot be discontinued at enrollment, that in the judgement of the PI, places them at unacceptable risk for a poor clinical outcome if they were to participate in the study.\n12. Received three or more doses of remdesivir, including the loading dose, outside of the study for COVID-19.\n13. Received convalescent plasma or intravenous immunoglobulin \\[IVIg\\] for the treatment of COVID-19.\n14. Received any interferon product within two weeks of screening, either for the treatment of COVID-19 or for a chronic medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis, HCV infection).\n15.
