Current or prior use of romosozumab or antisclerostin antibody.\n23. Current or prior use of other osteoporotic agents used for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis.\n24. Current use within 3 months before screening of any medication with known influence on the skeletal system (eg, systemic corticosteroids, heparin, lithium, etc) with exceptions described in the protocol.\n25. Concomitant treatment with another biologic drug.\n26. Have received a COVID-19 vaccine within 4 weeks before randomization or COVID-19 vaccination is ongoing at the time of screening.",
