It is composed of 8 questions, and each question has 5 choices. The 5 choices for each individual question are scores from 0 to 4, with 0 being the lowest level without any symptoms related to nausea/vomiting/retching and 4 being the highest level. Individual question scores can be tracked over time, or a composite score with a total scoring range of 0 to 32 can be formed by adding the individual scores of the symptom occurrence and degree of discomfort questions together. Composite scores classified as follows: 0: no symptoms, 1-8: mild, 9-16: moderate, 17-24: great, 25-32: severe.
