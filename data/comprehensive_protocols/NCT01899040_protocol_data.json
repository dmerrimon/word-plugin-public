    "criteria": "INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* The patient must have been diagnosed with episodic Migraine Headache at least 6 months prior to entering into the Study, consistent with the International Headache Classification of Headache Disorders-II (ICHD-II) guidelines.\n* The patient must have a history of at least three consecutive months of stable Migraine Headaches prior to entering the Study. The patients will not have had changes in medication usage for the three Months leading up to the Study, nor will they introduce new medications during the Study period. Patients will satisfy these criteria: On a Monthly basis, at least four, and not more than a total of fourteen (4-14), Headache Days (Pain Score between one and ten) of which between four and nine (4-14) are Migraine Headache Days\n* The patient must not have failed on more than two classes of properly administered prophylactic pharmaceutical therapies for migraine headache. The patient may be on a single migraine prophylactic as long as the dosage has not been altered within 3 months of starting the study and the dosage must not be altered for the duration of the study.\n* The Investigator must have confidence in the patient's ability to reliably use the Experimental Device and promptly complete the Daily Headache Diary forms. The Daily Headache Diary will be completed from the beginning of the Pre-Treatment Baseline Period through the end of the Pivotal Study.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nIndividuals who:\n\n* are pregnant\n* have a history of cardiovascular disease\n* work night shifts\n* have been diagnosed with vestibular migraine\n* have been diagnosed with migraine with aura\n* have menstrual migraine exclusively\n* have been diagnosed with post-traumatic migraine\n* have a history of unstable mood disorder or unstable anxiety disorder\n* use a hearing aid\n* have a cochlear implant\n* have chronic tinnitus\n* have temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disease\n* have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI)\n* have been diagnosed with neurological disease other than Headaches\n* have a diagnosed vestibular dysfunction\n* abuse alcohol or other drugs\n* are experiencing medication overuse Headaches (individuals with respect to whom the Investigator is concerned that analgesic abuse is involved based on the ICHD-II guidelines).\n* are younger than 18 years or older than 65 years\n* have had eye surgery within the previous three months or ear surgery within the previous six months\n* have active ear infections or a perforated tympanic membrane\n* have participated in another clinical trial within the last 30 days or are currently enrolled in another clinical trial\n* are using Botox treatments for migraines\n* Though not excluded, patients taking anti-histamines or anti-nausea drugs will be encouraged not to take such medications within four hours prior to using the Device. The Investigator should review other medications taken by the patient with properties that mimic anti-nausea or anti-dizziness drugs as these may reduce responsiveness to stimulation. Such medications should also be avoided within four hours prior to a treatment.",

The total scores rage from 0-63. The higher the score the more depressed. Mood scores are assessed for: decline, no change, or an improvement. A negative score indicates improvement in mood.",

The test consists of 14 balance- related tasks ranging from standing up from a sitting position to standing on one foot. Each task is graded from 0 - 4, and the final measure is the sum from all elements of the Test: • 41-56 = low risk of fall • 21-40 = medium risk of fall • 0-20 = high risk of fall. Possible scores range from 0-56. Scores of zero indicate no change in balance.",

The Digit-Symbol Subtest of the WAIS-III, is a timed pencil-and-paper task that measures processing speed and visual-motor coordination. It involves matching symbols to numbers using a key, with the goal of completing as many correct matches as possible within a 120-second time limit. The number of correct matches completed is counted. The lowest possible count is 0 (zero correct matches). The higher the number of correct matches completed, the better the cognitive speed of the participant. Cognitive speed will be assessed for: a decline, no change, or an improvement. A positive number indicates improvement.",

This assessment was created by the study Neuropsychologist where participants were shown faces at baseline then shown another set which included a subset then had seen before and had to say if they had seen them before later during the visit (to test short term memory). Scores range from 0-10. Higher scores indicate better short term memory. Memory scores were assessed for: a decline, no change, or an improvement from baseline to the end of treatment month 3.
