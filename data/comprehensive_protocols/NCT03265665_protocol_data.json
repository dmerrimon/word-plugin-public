The AQLQ items are each scored on a 7-point Likert scale, with 1 representing maximal impairment and 7 representing no impairment. Scores range 1-7, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. A total score was calculated by summing all responses for each question and then dividing by the number of items in the questionnaire (n=32). Subdomains were not reported/used.",

The ACQ score ranges between 0 (well controlled) and 6 (extremely poorly controlled). Recent studies show that a score of 1.5 or more on the 6-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) indicates that a patient has inadequate asthma control.Higher scores mean poorer asthma control.",
