For this instrument, 48 = no pain or disability; 0 = maximum pain and disability. Scores of 40 below were interpreted to indicate ongoing ankle pain of significance for pain and function, for example, at least 8 of the 12 questions being scored less than the optimal value of 4. Scores from 40 to 48 were interpreted as indicating normal or near normal function of the affected ankle.",
