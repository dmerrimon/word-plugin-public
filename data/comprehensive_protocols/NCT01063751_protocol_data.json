The EQ-5D Time Trade-off (TTO) descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/comfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems and extreme problems, where an overall score of 1 represents full health.\n\nThe index values on a scale between -1 (low) and 1 (high) are showing the average health status.
