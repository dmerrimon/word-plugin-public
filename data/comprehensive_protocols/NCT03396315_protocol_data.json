Hypocalcemia\n  2. Pregnancy\n  3. Known hypersensitivity to bisphosphonates\n* History of osteomalacia\n* History of osteonecrosis of the jaw\n* History of dental extraction or other invasive dental surgery within the prior 4 weeks\n* Invasive dental work planned in the next 12 months\n* Any condition or illness (acute, chronic, or history), which in the opinion of the Investigator might interfere with the evaluation of efficacy and safety during the study or may otherwise compromise the safety of the subject\n* Self-reported or known alcohol or drug abuse within the previous 12 months\n* Current or recent (within 1 year of enrollment) inflammatory bowel disease or malabsorption\n* Abnormal laboratory tests performed during Visit 1\n\n  1.

Hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia\n  3. Vitamin D deficiency: 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) \\< 30 ng/mL\n* Subjects must be willing to participate voluntarily. Specifically excluded are the following: 1) women less than 20 (or 35 in the case of those who wish to participate because they have low BMD); 2) protected individuals (institutionalized); 3) prisoners; 4) any other prospective participant who, for any reason, might not be able to give voluntary informed consent.",
