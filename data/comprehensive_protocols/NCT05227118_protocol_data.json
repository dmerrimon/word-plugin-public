Exceptions: (1) Adequately treated non-melanomatous skin carcinoma or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or; (2) Other malignancies that have been successfully treated with appropriate follow up and therefore unlikely to recur for the duration of the study\n* Has a family history of long QT syndrome\n* Previously developed severe extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) following administration of any prescribed medication or study treatment\n* Is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C antibodies or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n* Had major surgery, donated or lost 1 unit of blood (approximately 500 mL) within 4 weeks prior to the pre-study (screening) visit\n* Consumes greater than 3 glasses of alcoholic beverages per day\n* Consumes excessive amounts, defined as greater than 6 servings (1 serving is approximately equivalent to 120 mg of caffeine) of coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks, or other caffeinated beverages per day\n* Is a regular user of cannabis, any illicit drugs or has a history of drug (including alcohol) abuse within approximately 3 years",
