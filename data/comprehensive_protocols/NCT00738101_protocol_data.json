This will allow time for observation of any unexpected side effects and for parents to be provided education on home TPN and Omegaven®.\n\nIf a subject has already received Omegaven® either at TCH or at another hospital, they will not be required to be admitted for the 72 hour inpatient admission prior to starting Omegaven® at home. Parent training will occur during the previous hospital admission and will continue through the TCH Pediatric Intestinal Rehabilitation Clinic.\n\nOutpatient Monitoring:\n\nAfter the initial evaluation by the TCH Pediatric Intestinal Rehabilitation Clinic physicians, subjects will return to the clinic for routine follow-up. Subjects will be asked to return to the clinic every 2 weeks for the first 2 months of treatment. Thereafter, subjects will return to the clinic on a monthly basis, or as directed by the clinic team.",
