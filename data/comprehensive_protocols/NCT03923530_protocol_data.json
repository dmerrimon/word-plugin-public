    "criteria": "1. Enroll 10 subjects with hypertension and abnormal hemodynamics after TAVR.\n2. This is a greater than minimal risk study.\n\n   1. Inclusion criteria:\n\n      * TAVR procedure performed at the Malcom Randall VA Medical Center within the last 2 years.\n      * Intracardiac pressures recorded 5 to 10 minutes after TAVR and AVi \\< 0.6 mm Hg/bpm.\n      * History of hypertension, taking anti-hypertensive medications, or recent systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg.\n   2. Exclusion criteria:\n\n      * Serum potassium \\>5.5 mEq/L at initiation.\n      * Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inhibitor (i.e. ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, and nelfinavir).\n      * Type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria.\n      * Serum creatinine \\>2.0 for men and \\>1.8 for women.\n      * Creatinine clearance \\<50 cc/min.\n      * Concomitant administration of potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics.\n3. Subjects who are eligible to participate and signed an informed consent will be given eplerenone 50 mg daily. Study drug (eplerenone) will be paid by the North Florida Foundation for Research and Education for the duration of the study.\n\n   a. Down-titration or termination of non-essential anti-hypertensive agents is permissible so that eplerenone does not result in hypotension. Essential medications are as follows:\n   * Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) or angiotensin receptor blockers, if intolerant to ACE-inhibitors are indicated for treatment left ventricular dysfunction (i.e. left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%), diabetes, and proteinuric chronic kidney disease.\n   * Beta-blockers are indicated 3 years after an acute myocardial infarction, unless there is persistent left ventricular dysfunction (i.e. left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%).\n4. Monitoring.\n\n   a. Serum potassium within the last 30 days is required before initiating eplerenone. Repeat blood draw is required within the first week, and one month after the start of treatment with eplerenone.\n5. Quality of life questionnaire. a. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12) will be administered at baseline and 8 weeks. The KCCQ-12 instrument will be mailed to the subject. Study coordinator will call the subject at 8 weeks to confirm vital status, assess if any adverse reactions from eplerenone, and provide assistance to completing the KCCQ-12, if needed.",
