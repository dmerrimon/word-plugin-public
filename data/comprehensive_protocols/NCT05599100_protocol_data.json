        "description": "The Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist is a 24-item scale measuring caregiver reaction to memory, depression, and disruptive behavior problems. Each item asks about a problem the care recipient is experiencing. For each problem the care recipient experiences, caregivers are asked to rate how much the problem upsets the caregiver on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Scores for caregiver reaction are calculated by taking the sum of the individual items. Total scores can range from 0 to 96, with higher scores reflect caregivers being more upset when memory and behavior problems happen.\n\nWe report the change in scores by subtracting the total score at baseline from the total score at 6 weeks. The possible range for the change in total scores is from -96 to 96. A negative change indicates that caregivers' reaction has improved, while a positive change indicates that caregivers' reaction has worsened.",

The instrument contains 8 items that ask caregivers how well prepared they believe they are to provide physical care, emotional support, deal with the stress of caregiving, and set up in-home support services. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all prepared) to 4 (very well prepared). The score is calculated by taking the average of all items answered.\n\nWe report the change in average scores by subtracting the average score at baseline from the average score at 6 weeks. The possible range for the change in average scores is from -4 to 4. A negative change indicates that caregivers' preparedness has worsened, while a positive change indicates that caregivers' preparedness has improved.",

Caregivers rate their agreement with statements on a 5-point scale, from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree.\" A single score is calculated by converting each item's score to a 0-4 scale, summing the adjusted scores, and then multiplying by 2.5 to obtain a final score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better usability and caregiver satisfaction. General interpretive ranges suggest excellent usability (score of 85 and above), good usability (scores of 70-84), average usability (scores of 50-69), and poor usability (scores below 50).",
