Patients who have had two or more lines of chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease are not eligible, taking into account the following:\n\n  * Patients may have received up to one additional line of chemotherapy if given in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. If such treatment was completed less than 6 months prior to the current tumor recurrence or progression it is to be considered first-line treatment;\n  * No more than one line of non-cytotoxic systemic cancer therapy (such as immunotherapy, trastuzumab or protein kinase inhibitors) is allowed.\n* HER2 tumor expression defined as a 1+, 2+ or 3+ score on IHC or positive by ISH\n* At least one measurable cancer lesion as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumours (RECIST version 1.1);\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status â‰¤ 2;\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Current or previous use of a prohibited medication as listed in the protocol;\n* History of infusion-related reactions and/or hypersensitivity to trastuzumab;\n* History of keratitis;\n* Severe, uncontrolled systemic disease at screening;\n* Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) \\< 50%, or a history of clinically significant decrease in LVEF during previous treatment with trastuzumab;\n* History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease;\n* Symptomatic brain metastases, brain metastases requiring steroids to manage symptoms, or treatment for brain metastases within 8 weeks prior to randomization;\n* History or presence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g. bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan.",
