Change was measured by subtracting follow up from baseline.\n\nAstrocytic glutamine C4 enrichment is a measure of brain acetate metabolism (an alternate fuel to glucose). Previous studies have shown that in people who have been exposed to frequent hypoglycemic episodes, glutamine C4 enrichment increases. Therefore, we expected a reduction in Glutamine C4 percent enrichment in the follow up NMR scans in the intervention group who avoided frequent hypoglycemic episodes through the CL/AP system. In addition, there is no specific cut off value used for Glutamine C4 enrichment, rather a change or reduction was expected and noted.\"",
