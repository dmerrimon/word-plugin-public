The overall PAQLQ score is the mean of all 23 responses and the individual domain scores are the means of the items in those domains. A change in score greater than 0.5 on the 7-point scale can be considered clinically important.",

It consists of a descriptive system and a set of preference weights, giving utility values for each health state described by the descriptive system, allowing the calculation of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for use in cost utility analysis.\n\nFormat: Consists of nine dimensions of health-related quality of life, including worry, sadness, pain, tiredness, annoyance, school, sleep, daily routine, and activities. The child completes the questionnaire, or a proxy can complete it for younger children Scoring: Scores can range from -0.1059 (min) to 1 (max); with a score of 1 indicating a \"state of perfect health\", and a lower score indicating worse health. A minimally important difference (MID) of 0.03 is used to assess the magnitude of mean difference when comparing CHU9D scores.",
