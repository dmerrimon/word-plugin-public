Each QI-Disability item is rated on a Likert scale of: Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, and Very Often. Items were linearly transformed to a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better quality of life. Domain scores are calculated by averaging item scores. The domain scores are summed and divided by 6 to yield a total score. The total score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. A negative change from Baseline implies deteriorating quality of life. Mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) was used for analysis.",
