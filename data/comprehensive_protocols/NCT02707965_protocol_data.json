Subject is willing to be switched between brand and generic drug.\n7. Subject is willing to stop all non-routine OTC medications for 24 hours prior to and during pharmacokinetic study visits.\n8. Subject is willing to maintain stable doses of all other AEDs, including Vagus Nerve Stimulation parameters for the duration of the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subject has any medical condition, including a progressive neurological condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, could jeopardize the subject's health or would compromise the subject's ability to participate in the trial.\n2. Subject has a history of alcohol or drug abuse, which in the opinion of the investigator, could jeopardize the subject's health or would compromise the subject's ability to participate in this trial.\n3. Subject has a history of previous or current significant psychiatric disorder that would interfere with conduct of the study.\n4. Subject is pregnant or lactating.\n5. Subject has severe liver impairment as assessed by alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or total bilirubin levels â‰¥10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).\n6.

Female subjects of childbearing potential will not be eligible to participate who are unwilling or unable to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the entire study period and for one week after the study is completed. Medically acceptable methods of contraception that may be used by the subject and/or her partner are: condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, IUD without progesterone, vaginal spermicidal suppository, surgical sterilization of their partner(s) or abstinence.\n8.
