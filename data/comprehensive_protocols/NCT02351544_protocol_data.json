One of the goals of this trial is to determine this.\n* Patients who respond to diagnostic botulinum toxin injection or to a diagnostic anesthetic block\n* Patients who have failed 2 of 3 classes of preventative migraine medications\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients deemed by the authors or the neurologist to not have migraine headaches, but an alternative diagnosis\n* Patients with systemic conditions that make them poor candidates for surgery (coronary artery disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, etc…)\n* Patients with migraines related to inferior turbinate hypertrophy or septal deviation\n* Patients with a frontal, temporal or occipital trigger point who do not respond to a diagnostic botulinum toxin injection or to a diagnostic anesthetic block\n* Hypersensitivity to any botulinum toxin preparation or to any of the components in the formulation\n* Infection at the proposed injection site for botulinum\n* Patients with trigger points at minor trigger sites (lesser occipital nerve, third occipital nerve)",

Therefore, MWPLQ7 was analyzed independently, and the remaining questions were not included in the final analysis. Question #7 assesses the difficulty of 18 work-related activities caused by the most recent MH or migraine headache treatment. Each item in question 7 has the following options: 0 ('no difficulty'), 1 ('a slight amount'), 2 ('some'), 3 ('quite a bit'), 4 ('a great deal'), 5 ('so much difficulty, could not do at all'), and 6 ('does not apply to my work'). To quantify difficulty, a total sum score of these 18 items including only options 0 to 5 is obtained. A higher MWPLQ7 summed score reveals a higher (worse) effect of MH on work and productivity.
