These unitless rankings were used in a Sum of Ranks statistical analysis to compare cartilage changes across different knee joint regions without assuming normality (as appropriate for MRI data). There are no published standards for what would be considered a clinically significant effect for sum-of-ranks cartilage T2 data, so it was assumed that a statistically significant difference would imply clinical significance as well.",
