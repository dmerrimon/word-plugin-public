Mothers must have adequate capacity to participate in the LENA intervention as well as understand what they will be asked to do as participants.\n* Score 8 or higher on the Patient Health Questionnaire - (PHQ-9). This score is indicative of depressive symptoms.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Currently pregnant by self-report.\n* Child is completely deaf",
