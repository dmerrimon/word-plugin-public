Subjects who are immunosuppressed, including those with known immunodeficiency or have active infection or other serious illnesses.\n6. Active infection including tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Subjects with a past or resolved HBV infection were eligible. Subjects positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody were eligible only if polymerase chain reaction was negative for HCV RNA.\n7.

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, bleeding disorders, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, or serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea.\n9. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following the last durvalumab treatment or for 6 months after the last dose of tremelimumab (whichever was longer).\n10. History of allogeneic organ transplant.\n11. History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.\n12. Active or prior malignancy except for history of other prior malignancy treated with curative intent which, in the opinion of the treating Investigator and the Sponsor, had minimal risk of interfering with safety or efficacy endpoints of the study.\n13. Women of childbearing potential who were pregnant as evidenced by positive serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin \\[HCG\\]) or nursing.\n14.
