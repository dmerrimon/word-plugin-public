Neural activity will be measured as participants listen to acoustic stimuli in accented speech. The un-transformed voltage represents the difference in electric potential between a specific electrode contact and the reference electrode contact; since we use a common average reference, that means it's the difference between a specific electrode contact and the mean voltage across all electrodes. We then z-score to characterize shifts from baseline activity (where z = 0) at a specific electrode, which is believed to measure changes in voltage due largely to post-synaptic currents. This is a mathematical transformation rather than a published scale or standardized assessment. More extreme z-scores (+ or -) indicate a greater change from baseline local neural activity; in other words, stimuli evoked greater activity in this region.",
