An event had to be confirmed by the PAC at two consecutive visits. In case no confirmed event was observed for a participant, the observation was censored, and the censoring date was defined as the last date where the diagnostic classification was assessed. The Study was terminated and only confirmed events collected up to the data cut-off point were counted. Due to the early termination of the study only a small number of events were observed and time-to-event could not be analyzed.
