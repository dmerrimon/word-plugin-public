It is suggested that calculation of blood loss using preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels in most consistently accurate. In order to minimize the risk of bias associated with any one method of intraoperative measurement of blood loss, three methods will be used independently. In the operating room, all blood and fluid aspirated from the abdomen will be measured accurately using graduated suction containers. As well, the amount of irrigation fluid will be carefully monitored and recorded. Finally, the weight of all surgical sponges will be measured. This information will be used by the surgeon and anesthesiologist to independently visually estimate blood loss, as is commonly done in clinical practice. In parallel, intraoperative blood loss will also be calculated based on an equation.",
