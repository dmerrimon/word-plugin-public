    "criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aged 18 years or above\n* Evidence of cirrhosis, based on either radiological and/or clinical features\n* History of varices, variceal haemorrhage or portal hypertension warranting NSBB\n* Removal or suppression of the primary aetiological factor (i.e., sustained virological response in chronic hepatitis C, complete hepatitis B virus DNA suppression in chronic hepatitis B, and long-term alcohol abstinence in alcohol-related liver disease)\n* LSM \\<25 kPa\n* Provision of written informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Active aetiological factors not addressed in the inclusion criteria (e.g., autoimmune or hereditary liver diseases). However, hepatic steatosis-commonly coexisting with other liver diseases-is not an exclusion criterion unless accompanied by high plasma alanine aminotransferase \\>40 U/L or confirmed steatohepatitis.\n* Recent hepatic decompensation within the past year (total bilirubin \\>50 μmol/L, prothrombin time \\>1.3 times the upper normal limit \\[unless attributable to use of anti-coagulation\\], albumin \\<35 g/L, or presence of ascites, variceal haemorrhage or hepatic encephalopathy). Notably, the Baveno VI criteria used LSM \\<20-25 kPa and normal platelet count \\>150×109/L to rule out varices requiring treatment (19). However, in line with the Baveno VII consensus, which sets an LSM \\<25 kPa as the threshold for considering NSBB discontinuation, thrombocytopenia is not an exclusion criterion to allow the cohort to include a wider spectrum of patients.\n* Current or history of hepatocellular carcinoma.\n* Radiological evidence of portal vein thrombosis.\n* History of other malignancies (unless in complete remission for \\>5 years).\n* History of liver transplantation or liver resection.\n* Contraindications to undergoing endoscopy.\n* Other clinical indications for NSBB (e.g., cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension)",
