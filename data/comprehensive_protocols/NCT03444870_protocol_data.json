Structured interview prompts recollection of suicidal ideation, including intensity of ideation, behavior, \\& attempts with actual/potential lethality. Categories have binary responses (yes/no) \\& include Wish to be Dead; Non-specific Active Suicidal Thoughts; Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act; Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan; Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent, Preparatory Acts and Behavior; Aborted Attempt; Interrupted Attempt; Actual Attempt (non-fatal); Completed Suicide. Suicidal ideation/behavior is indicated by a \"yes\" answer to any of the listed categories. Score of 0 is assigned if no suicide risk is present. Score of 1 or higher= suicidal ideation or behavior. Categories with non-zero values are only reported here.",
