Variable strategies used by women to introduce HIV self-testing to their male partners. 3. Range of male partner responses to receiving an HIV self-testing kit. 4. Women's confidence in ability to interpret HIV self-test results for their partners. 5. Women's strategies to persuade their partners to link to HIV care or HIV PrEP.",
