However, once the patient is no longer contraindicated to receiving MRIs, the study schedule may resume with their next scheduled MRI time point from the date of enrollment. Therefore, some time points may be skipped during the patient's enrollment in the study.\n\nAlso, if a patient needs a repeat MRI at any time point for any reason (i.e. panic attack during the MRI causing them to not be able to continue, unreadable images, etc.), we may repeat the MRI as long as the patient is willing.",
