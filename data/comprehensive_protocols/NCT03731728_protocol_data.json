It contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. The standardized cutoffs used are as follows: 0-13: minimal depression; 14-19: mild depression; 20-28: moderate depression; 29-63: severe depression.",

The client is asked to respond to 34 questions about how they have been feeling over the last week, using a 5-point scale ranging from 'not at all' to 'most or all of the time'. The questionnaire covers four dimensions: subjective well-being, problems/symptoms, life functioning and risk/harm. Key points in the scoring are as follows: each item within the CORE Outcome Measure is scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (most or all the time). The total score is calculated by adding the response values of all 34 items. The minimum score that can be achieved is 0 and the maximum 136. The total mean score is calculated by dividing the total score by the number of completed item responses. Symptoms sub-scale includes 12 items with a total score range of 0 to 48 and mean score range of 0 to 4 with a cut-off point of 1.44 for males and 1.62 for females.",

The clinical score is calculated by adding the response values of all 10 items and ranges from 0 to 40. The higher the score the more problems the individual is reporting and/or the more distressed they are. A score of 10 or below denotes a score within the non-clinical range and of 11 or above within the clinical range. Within the clinical range the score of 11 is the lower boundary of the 'mild' level, 15 for the 'moderate' level, and 20 for the 'moderate-to-severe' level.

It consists of 6 questions and assesses physical activity undertaken across a comprehensive set of domains including walking, moderate-intensity activities and vigorous-intensity activities. Computation of the total score requires summation of the duration (in minutes) and frequency (days) of physical activity. Volume of activity can be computed by weighting each type of activity by its energy requirements defined in METs to yield a score in MET-minutes. METs are multiples of the resting metabolic rate and a MET-minute is computed by multiplying the MET score of an activity by the minutes performed. MET-minute scores are equivalent to kilocalories for a 60 kilogram person. Kilocalories may be computed from MET-minutes using the following equation: MET-min x (weight in kilograms/60 kilograms). MET-minutes/week will be reported.",
