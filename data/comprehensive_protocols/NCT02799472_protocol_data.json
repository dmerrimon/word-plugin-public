        "description": "RAMRIQ is an automated volume quantification assessment. RAMRIQ assessed same pathologies and joints (except metacarpophalangeal joint \\[MCP1\\]) as RAMRIS allowing for direct comparison of results obtained using the two methods. Bones were automatically identified in pre-contrast, coronal T1 images using active appearance modelling (AAMs). Joint capsules and soft tissues were also segmented with AAMs, providing consistent 3D regions of interest (ROI) for synovial enhancement across all time points. Synovial volume was calculated as voxels that enhance within each ROI. Baseline was defined at Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose value from the Baseline value. Repeated measures analysis adjusted for Synovitis baseline value, treatment group, disease duration (\\<=2 or \\>2 years), visit and treatment group by visit interaction. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).",
