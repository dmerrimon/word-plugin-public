However, PBC participants accompanied with primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (pSS) are eligible to be enrolled.\n* History or evidence of clinically significant hepatic decompensation\n* Medical conditions that may cause non-hepatic increases in ALP (e.g., Paget's disease)\n* Clinically significant infections within 6 weeks prior to treatment start, or infection with hepatitis C virus anytime in the past\n* Immunosuppressive, immunomodulating, or investigational agents within 30 days prior to treatment start\n* Treatment with obeticholic acid (OCA) within 30 days prior to Day 1\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply",
