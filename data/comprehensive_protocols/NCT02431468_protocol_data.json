Efficacy analyses were conducted according to randomized groups. The SIB is used to assess cognition in subjects with moderate and severe AD. It is divided into nine subscales that include attention, language, orientation, memory, praxis, visuospatial ability, construction, social skills, orienting head to name. Non-verbal responses are allowed, thus decreasing the need for language output. Forty questions are included with a point score range of 0-100. Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.",
