        "description": "This experiment will use a machine learning analysis -- multivariate pattern classification -- to \"decode\" the brain signals measured by the electrocorticography electrodes. That is, the analysis will determine if the face/word/scene that is being remembered is being represented by these particular brain signals). The primary outcome will be to assess what happens to the neural representation of, say, a face, when the patient is probed that the other stimulus presented on that trial will be tested first - i.e., the analysis will assess the decodability of the two items as a function of their priority for upcoming task demands. Reported here is the categorical performance of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) trained using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure to decode the prioritized and unprioritized memory items (faces, scenes, or words).",

The primary outcome measure is whether the level of phase-amplitude coupling associated with a stimulus will change (increase, decrease, change to different frequencies) after that stimulus is prioritized or deprioritized by the cue. Reported here is the direction of PAC between low theta oscillations (6 Hz) and high-gamma bursts (\\>140 Hz) in binary terms according to whether the PAC increased or decreased for the three stimulus types (faces, scenes, or words) in electrode signals analyzed in different brain regions.",

The primary outcome measure is whether the level of phase-amplitude coupling in tissue representing a region of space that is irrelevant for an entire block of trials will change in a manner that mirrors the dynamic changes expected for each trial's uncued location, or whether it will be insensitive to shifts of attention that are, by definition, never relevant for that tissue over the course of that block of trials.",
