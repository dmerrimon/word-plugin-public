Current CD4+ T cell count \\> 300 cells/μl.\n5. If sexually active male or female, and participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy or transmission of HIV, agrees to use two effective methods of contraception (i.e. condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, hormone-eluting IUD, hormone-based contraceptive with condom) from 10 days prior to and six months after 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS administration.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Have a history of AIDS-defining illness within 3 years prior to enrollment.\n2. History of systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive anti-cancer, or other medications considered significant by the trial physician within the last 6 months.\n3. Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition (such as autoimmune diseases), other than HIV infection, that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation.\n4. Hepatitis B or C infection as indicated by the presence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV-RNA) in blood.\n5. Laboratory abnormalities in the parameters listed below:\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count ≤ 1,000 cells/μl;\n   * Hemoglobin ≤ 10 gm/dL;\n   * Platelet count ≤ 100,000 cells/μl;\n   * ALT ≥ 1.5 x ULN;\n   * AST ≥ 1.5 x ULN;\n   * Alkaline phosphatase ≥ 1.5 x ULN;\n   * Total bilirubin \\> 1.25 x ULN;\n   * eGFR \\< 60 mL/min/1.73m2.\n6. Pregnancy or lactation.\n7. Any vaccination within 14 days prior to mAb infusions, except for influenza vaccine.\n8. Receipt of another investigational product currently or within the past 12 weeks, or expected concurrent participation in another study in which investigational products will be administered.\n9. Receipt of any experimental HIV vaccine or anti-HIV monoclonal antibody therapy in the past.\n10. History of severe reaction to a vaccine or drug infusion or history of severe allergic reactions.\n11. Individuals with known hypersensitivity to any constituent of the investigational products.",
