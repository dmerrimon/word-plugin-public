Subjects who have received vigabatrin in the past must have documentation of an assessment for vision loss prior to study entry or documentation of why visual field testing cannot be performed\n* Subject has been treated with felbamate and has experienced any serious toxicity issues (defined as liver failure, aplastic anemia) with this treatment. Subjects treated with felbamate for \\<12 months are excluded. Note: any subject who has been treated with felbamate for ≥12 months and has not experienced serious toxicity issues is eligible\n* Subject has a medically documented history of alcohol or drug abuse\n* Subject has a known cardiac sodium channelopathy, such as Brugada syndrome\n* Subject has an acute or sub acutely progressive central nervous system disease.
