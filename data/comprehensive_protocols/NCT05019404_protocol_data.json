The WAIS-IV also provides two overall summary scores including a Full-Scale IQ and a General Ability Index (GAI), where FSIQ is a measurement of performance across all subcategories, but the GAI is more resistant to issues that might arise from cognitive impairment, allowing for a more precise and truthful analysis. Higher score means better outcome. Intelligence is classified according to the total score : 1) extremely abnormal with more than 130 points; 2) Exceptional: 120-129 points; 3) Higher than usual: 110-119 points; 4) Normal: 90-109 points; 5) Lower than usual: 80-89 points; 6) Boundary: 70-79 points; 7) Mental Retardation: lower than 69 points.",
