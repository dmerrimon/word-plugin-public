The mRS is a seven-point scale (0=no symptoms at all; 1=no significant disability despite symptoms; 2=slight disability; 3=moderate disability; 4=moderately severe disability; 5=severe disability; 6=death). To avoid issues with model convergence due to sparse data, I will a priori categorize the mRS into good (mRS 0-2) versus poor (mRS 3-6) outcomes. These data were collected during the parent study (NCT01169259)",

The scale covers five social areas (housekeeping, transportation, social interaction, food preparation, and grocery shopping). Respondents are grouped into four categories (need met, no apparent problem (best outcome); need met, potential problem; uncertain need met, potential problem; need unmet, current problem (worst outcome)) for each social area using a previously published algorithm.\n\nWe created summary indices for the total number of unmet needs across all areas and for the total number of unmet needs or uncertain needs met, potential problem. These indices range from 0 to 5, but to avoid problems with model convergence due to sparse data, we will a priori categorize them as 0 (best outcome), 1, or â‰¥2 (worst outcome).",
