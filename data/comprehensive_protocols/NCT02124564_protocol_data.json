However, concomitant use of benzodiazepines on an as needed basis is not permitted.)\n* Female subject who is pregnant or nursing, and/or a woman of childbearing potential who is not surgically sterile, 2 years postmenopausal or does not practice 1 highly effective method of contraception, unless sexually abstinent, for the duration of the study\n* Female subject of childbearing potential taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EI-AEDs: CBZ, phenytoin, barbiturates, primidone, topiramate) who is not surgically sterile, 2 years postmenopausal or does not practice 1 highly effective method of contraception according to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation (ie, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethisterone enantate, intrauterine devices, combined injectables, and progestogen implants) with administration of EI-AEDs or does not practice 2 combined methods of contraception (ie, combined hormonal contraception plus barrier method with spermicidal agent), unless sexually abstinent, for the duration of the study\n* Subject has sick sinus syndrome without a pacemaker, or a second or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block, or subject has any other clinically relevant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities\n* Subject has a history of convulsive status epilepticus within the last 12 months prior to Visit 1",
