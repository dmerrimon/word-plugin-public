BMI z-scores (or standard deviation scores) are used in anthropometry to quantify a measurement's distance from the mean. The measurement is obtained using the sex, age, weight and height of the participants. The z-score is based on United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth references for children. A z-score of 0 reflects the 50th percentile based on the reference growth charts. For example, a z-score of 1.5 indicates a child is 1.5 standard deviations above the average value, whereas a z-score of -1.5 means a child is 1.5 standard deviations below the average value.",
