Through focus groups held via synchronous video conferences, we will engage with patients and clinical providers to identify patient- and provider-reported themes that emerge in how clinical prediction models can support decision making in the care of patients with COVID-19. Themes will be identified through qualitative analysis of patient and provider feedback. We expect to elicit patient and provider beliefs, opinions and values around the scientific, ethical and pragmatic aspects of use of these models to support decision making.",
