Participants in Part A Group 2 completed the assessments at home first, followed by on-site assessment. The goal of Part A was to evaluate the comparability of remote and on-site clinical assessments. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), a measure of agreement for continuous outcome measures, was used to determine agreement between remote and onsite assessments for each outcome measure. Outcome measure tested were the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog13), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB).",

Florbetapir PET scans at baseline and at 36 weeks after the first treatment were used to quantitatively estimate change in amyloid plaques. Quantitative amyloid burden was first formalized as the average Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in six predetermined cortical areas of the brain relative to the cerebellum as a reference region. Larger SUVR reflects the larger cortical amyloid burden relative to cerebellum. SUVR values were further calibrated to a centiloid (CL) scale. The Centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scan.
