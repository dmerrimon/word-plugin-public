This includes a barrier method such as condom or diaphragm with spermicide; barrier intrauterine device (IUD) or abstinence.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cognitive impairment (judged by the clinician taking consent as not having sufficient mental capacity to understand the study and its requirements). This is including anyone who, in the opinion of the clinician taking consent is unlikely to retain sufficient mental capacity for the duration of their involvement in the study.\n* Patients with any other medical condition that would interfere with study conduct or make it unsafe for them to participate\n* Pregnancy test positive.",
