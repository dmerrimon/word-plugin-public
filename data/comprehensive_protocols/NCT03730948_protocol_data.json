Numbers of peptide-specific CD8+ T cells will be measured by flow cytometric-based intracellular cytokine or tetramer staining. Flow cytometric assays will include an examination of the influence of immunotherapy on the ability of subject T cells to exhibit phenotypic markers associated with cytolytic potential (e.g. IFN-y, IL-2, TNF-alpha, Granzyme B) after short-term stimulation by mutated peptide and p-HLA multimer staining. PBMC responses against a pool of known antigenic Cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr Virus and Influenza epitopes will be evaluated in order to track general cellular immune competence during the study.",
