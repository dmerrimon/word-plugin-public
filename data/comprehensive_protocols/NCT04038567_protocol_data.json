Managed in an adult medical cardiac, trauma, surgical, or neurological ICU, stepdown unit, or monitored ward unit for ≥24 hours during the time inclusion criterion #2 is met.\n4. Cognitive status intact\n\n   * No history of pre-existing significant cognitive impairment (e.g., dementia) as per medical chart\n   * Absence of current significant cognitive impairment (impairment defined as ≥3 errors on the Callahan cognitive status screen)\n   * Decisional capacity present\n5. Absence of severe and/or persistent mental illness\n\n   * Treatment for severe and/or persistent mental illness (e.g., psychosis, bipolar affective disorder, schizoaffective disorder, schizoid personality disorder, schizophrenia \\[as per medical record\\], hospitalization for any psychiatric disorder) within the 6 months preceding the current hospital admission\n   * No endorsement of suicidality at time of admission or informed consent\n   * No active substance abuse within the 3 months preceding the current admission serious enough to limit completion of study procedures in the opinion of the site investigator.\n6. English fluency.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA (in hospital):\n\n1. Hospitalized within the preceding 3 months with life-threatening illness or injury.\n\n   Patients may be enrolled into the study if they had a hospitalization within the preceding 3 months that is determined to be non-serious. Non-serious admissions are defined as those admissions that are non-life threatening and/or potentially impacting patient's well-being long-term or likely to precipitate additional future admissions. Examples of non-life-threatening hospitalizations could be, but may not be limited to, admission for a bronchoscopy, admission for deep vein thrombosis, or admission to ED resulting in overnight stay for cardiac work-up.\n2. Admitted from a location other than home (e.g., nursing home, long-term acute care facility, inpatient rehabilitation facility)\n3. Anticipated or actual discharge to a location other than independent in a home setting (e.g., nursing home, long-term acute care facility, inpatient rehabilitation facility, home hospice)\n4. Complex medical care expected soon after discharge (e.g., planned surgeries, transplantation evaluation, extensive travel needs for hemodialysis, disruptive chemotherapy/radiation regimen)\n5. Unable to complete study procedures as determined by staff\n6. Lack of reliable smartphone with cellular data plan or wifi access\n\n   EXCLUSION CRITERIA (at T1, post-discharge):\n7. Low baseline psychological distress symptoms, defined as the absence of the following at T1: PHQ-9 score \\<5\n8. Failure to randomize within 2 month (60 days) post-discharge.",
