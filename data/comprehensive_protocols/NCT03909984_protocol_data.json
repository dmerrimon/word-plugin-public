Simultaneous use of a baby phone (or other types of microphones) is permitted.\n* Subjects who are not sleeping alone in the bed (i.e. co-sleeping in the parents'/guardians' bed influences the remote SDD). Subjects and parents/guardians are not allowed to change their sleeping habits for the duration of the study only.",
