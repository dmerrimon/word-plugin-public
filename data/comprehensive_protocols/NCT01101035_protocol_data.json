The participant has received urate-lowering therapy (i.e., febuxostat, allopurinol, probenecid, etc.) or excluded medication during the screening period (beginning with Day -7).\n4. The participant has a known hypersensitivity to febuxostat or allopurinol or any components of their formulation.\n5. The participant has active peptic ulcer disease.\n6. The participant has a history of cancer (other than basal cell carcinoma of the skin) within 5 years prior to the first dose of study medication.\n7. The participant had MI or stroke within 60 days prior to the Screening Visit.\n8. The participant has alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal (×ULN) during the Screening period.\n9.
