Note: Any woman becoming pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the study.\n* The participant is known to be allergic to albuterol or any of the excipients in the IMP or rescue medication formulation (that is, lactose \\[milk protein\\]). Dietary lactose intolerance does not exclude the participant from inclusion in the study or as per the investigator's medical discretion.\n* The participant has a history or presence of \"silent\" infections, including positive testing for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis.\n\n  * Additional criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information.",
