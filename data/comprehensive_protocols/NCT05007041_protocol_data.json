Intention of being available for entire study period and complete all relevant study procedures, including follow-up phone calls and clinic visits.\n7. If HIV positive, HIV should be clinically stable.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. IIV or recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) receipt during the respective 2021-2022 or 2022-2023 influenza season prior to study enrollment\n2. Prior receipt of recombinant zoster vaccine (SHINGRIX®)\n3. For non-COVID-19 Vaccines:\n\n   * Receipt of any inactivated vaccine within 2 weeks prior to enrollment in this study\n   * Receipt of any live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to enrollment in this study\n   * Planning receipt of any non-COVID-19 vaccine during the entire period\n4. For COVID-19 Vaccines:\n\n   * Receipt of COVID-19 vaccine within 2 weeks prior to enrollment in this study. For those who have initiated a COVID-19 vaccine series, enrollment is not allowed until 2 weeks after the final dose of a COVID-19 vaccine is completed.\n   * Planning receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine within 2 weeks after administration of study influenza and first dose recombinant zoster study vaccines.\n5. Have acute illness or exacerbation of chronic illness within 72 hours of study vaccination\n6. Hospitalization within the last 30 days for any reason\n7. History of febrile illness (\\> 100.0°F or 37.8°C) within the past 24 hours prior to IIV administration\n8. Has immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment, or use of chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 12 months\n9. Has an active neoplastic disease (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer or prostate cancer that is stable in the absence of therapy) \\*Participants with a history of malignancy may be included if, after previous treatment by surgical excision, chemotherapy or radiation therapy, the participant has been observed for a period that in the investigator's estimation provides a reasonable assurance of sustained cure\n10. A history of autoimmune disease, that requires immunosuppressive agents or any other chronic medical condition considered clinically significant by the investigator\n11. Use of chronic oral or intravenous administration (≥14 days) of immunosuppressive doses of steroids, i.e., prednisone \\>10 mg per day, immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within 30 days of starting this study. (Use of topical, nasal, or inhaled steroids is permitted)\n12. Thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorder, or anticoagulant use contraindicating intramuscular injection (a daily aspirin may be acceptable)\n13. Contraindication to IIV receipt including history of severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of any influenza vaccine; or to a vaccine component, including egg protein\n14. Contraindication to RZV including history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of the RZV vaccine (including saponin or polysorbate 80) or to dose 2 of RZV\n15. History of Guillain-Barré syndrome\n16. History of Hepatitis C or active Hepatitis B\n17. Receipt of blood or blood-derived products (including immunoglobulin) within 6 months prior to study vaccination\n18. Dementia, any cognitive condition, or substance abuse that could interfere with study compliance\n19. Anyone who is already enrolled or plans to enroll in another clinical trial with an investigational product within 28 days of vaccine receipt. Co-enrollment in observational or behavioral intervention studies are allowed at any time while enrollment in a clinical trial involving an investigational product (other than vaccine) may occur after 28 days following vaccine receipt\n20. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigators, may pose a health risk to the subject or interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives\n21. Anyone who is a relative of any research study personnel\n22. Anyone who is an employee of any research study personnel",
