Put the subject at risk because of participation in the study\n  2. Cause concern regarding the subject's ability to participate in this study \\*e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, severe liver disease, psoriasis, hematological, infectious and psychiatric diseases\n* Documented history of asthma. For allergic rhinitis or atopy, source documentation to verify that the subject does not have asthma\n* Planned surgery during the study expected to interfere with study procedures and outcome\n* Blood withdrawal of more than 100 mL within the past 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 and between Visit 1 and 2\n* Significant alcohol or drug abuse within past 2 years prior to Visit 1\n* Women who are pregnant, nursing or plan to become pregnant while in the study\n* Place of permanent residence of less than 3 months prior to Visit 1\n* For the MRI subset: subject who do not meet the following criteria for the MRI assessment at Visit 2: systolic blood pressure between 90 and 180 mmHg (SBP), diastolic blood pressure between 50 and 110 mmHg (DBP), pulse rate between 40 and 110 bpm, ear temperature between 35 - 37.5 C, and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \\>= 30 mL/min (GFR must not be older than 14 days from the MRI assessment)\n\nExclusion Criteria Specific for Patients with COPD\n\n\\- Respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in the 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period prior to Visit 2, if rescheduling rules cannot be met\n\nExclusion Criteria Specific Patients with COPD and A1AT Deficiency\n\n* Newly added anti-inflammatory treatment within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1\n* Patients on treatment with PDE (Phosphodiesterase)-5 inhibitors (e.g. Roflumilast) and maintenance treatment Methylxanthines (e.g. Theophylline)\n* Hospitalisation for respiratory failure during the year prior to Visit 1\n* A history of cystic fibrosis\n* Clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis requiring specific treatment\n* Clinically relevant abnormal baseline hematology and blood chemistry\n* Known active tuberculosis\n* Patients with change in any therapy within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1\n* Current and planned A1AT augmentation therapy\n* A malignancy for which the patient has undergone resection, radiation or chemotherapy within past 5 years.
