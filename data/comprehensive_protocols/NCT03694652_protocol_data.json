Scores were converted by the overall time spent in aerobic exercises per week and range from 0 to 180 with higher scores indicating more time spent doing aerobic exercises.",

The total score is calculated from the sum of section scores divided by 5 (range from 4.4 to 17 with higher scores representing more unhealthy eating habits)",
