For each test, a standardized z-score was calculated. The GCCS was the average of the non-missing individual test z-scores. A higher score indicated better cognitive function.\n\nCogState GCCS changes from baseline (randomization) were analyzed using a repeated measures ANCOVA in which treatment, age stratification factor, Mini mental state examination stratification factor, education level, Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele status, cerebrovascular disease burden at screening, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction are included as fixed-effect factor, and baseline (randomization) GCCS and visit-by- baseline GCCS as covariates with a common unstructured covariance matrix among visits between treatment groups. The analysis was based on a direct likelihood method with an assumption of Missing at random.",

PET imaging was performed at selected PET-capable centers on all eligible patients participating in the substudy. Sites with patients performing the PET scan were a subset of the overall patient population and overall sites for the study.\n\nChange from baseline to 3 years was analyzed based on an ANCOVA model with treatment, age, MMSE, amyloid status (+ve/-ve) stratification factors, region, APOE4 status and cerebrovascular disease burden as fixed effects, with baseline SUVr and treatment-by-baseline SUVr interaction as covariates for each of these imputed datasets. Results were obtained by applying Rubin's rules on the estimates from the imputed datasets.",
