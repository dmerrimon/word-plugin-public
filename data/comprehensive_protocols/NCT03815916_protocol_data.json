Patients with clinically significant hepatic or renal dysfunction or clinical laboratory findings that would limit the interpretability of change in liver or kidney function, or those with low platelet counts (\\<150 x 109 per liter) or eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count of â‰¥500 eosinophils per microliter) at Screening.\n9. Patient participating in any other investigational drug trial or using investigational drug (within 12 weeks prior to screening and thereafter)\n10. Positive screen for drugs of abuse or known history of alcohol abuse.\n11. Women of child-bearing potential, or men, who are unwilling or unable to use accepted methods of birth control for up to 6 months following study participation.\n12. Women with a positive pregnancy test, are lactating, or are planning to become pregnant during the study or within 6 months of the end of this trial.\n13. Patients with implanted metal objects in their body that may be affected by an MRI procedure.\n14. Patients who are claustrophobic or otherwise unlikely to be able to complete the MRI scanning procedures.\n15. History of allergy to gold in any form.\n16. Patient is considered a suicide risk in the opinion of the Investigator, has previously made a suicide attempt, or is currently demonstrating active suicidal ideation. Subjects with intermittent passive suicidal ideation are not necessarily excluded based on the assessment of the Investigator.",
