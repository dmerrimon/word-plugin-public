Replacement therapy is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Has history of a diagnosed and/or treated hematologic or primary solid tumor malignancy, unless in remission for at least 5 years prior to randomization\n* Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis\n* Has had previous allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant\n* Has active infection requiring systemic therapy\n* Has a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to pembrolizumab, Cisplatin or radiotherapy or their analogs\n* Is pregnant or breast feeding or expecting to conceive or father children throughout the study period and for up to 180 days after the last dose of study therapy",
