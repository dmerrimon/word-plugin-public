To do this, the effect of Topiramate (shown to be effective in cortical depressions) will be compared with that of Levetiracetam (which has not been shown to be effective in cortical depressions). This is going to be done by a questionnaire that will assess the resolution of symptoms or not, or the percentage of diminution.",

As demonstrated in studies on rats, cortical spreading depolarization respond well to TPM and not to LEV. Cortical depolarizations will then be the main hypothesis of the reason why some responds better to TPM than LEV in our study.",
