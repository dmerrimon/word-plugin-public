        "description": "To assess the persistence of immune response elicited by a single dose of meningococcal vaccine, the Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) from baseline to Day 730 of rSBA titers to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, Y and X is estimated, with 95% CI.\n\nEndpoints are the rSBA titer values for meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, Y and X from samples collected at Visit 1 (Day 1) and Visit 5 (Day 730).\n\nThe point and interval estimates will be obtained from a back transformation of the estimated mean difference of the log-transformed rSBA titers.",
