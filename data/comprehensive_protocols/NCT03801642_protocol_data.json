Diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes treated with insulin, sulfonylureas, glucagon like peptide1 receptor agonists (GLP-1), thiazolidinedione (TZD) or SGLT2 inhibitors (metformin monotherapy is allowed).\n4. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR; MDRD) \\<45 mL/min at screening or unstable renal disease.\n5. Any condition when MRI is contraindicated such as, but not limited to, having a pacemaker or claustrophobia.\n6. Severe hepatic injury and/or significant abnormal liver function defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \\>3x upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\>3x ULN. Total bilirubin \\>2.0 mg/dL (34.2 μmol/L)\n7. Intolerance or allergy to dapaglifozin or any other SGLT2 inhibitor or any other substance in the tablets.\n8. Dementia due to causes other than AD\n9. History of recurrent urinary tract infection\n10. Active mycotic genital infection\n11. History of bladder cancer\n12. History of diabetic ketoacidosis\n13. Potentially confounding, serious, or unstable medical conditions such as:\n\n    1. cancer within the past 3 years (except basal cell, squamous cell, or localized prostate cancer)\n    2. a recent cardiac event (i.e. heart attack, angioplasty, etc. within the 3 months prior to screening visit)\n    3. other conditions that pose a potential safety risk or confounding factor in the investigator's opinion\n14. Any abnormal physical examination assessment or vital sign assessment at the screening visit that is deemed to be clinically significant by the principal investigator.\n15. Any abnormal clinical laboratory test result at the screening visit that is deemed to be clinically significant by the principal investigator.",
