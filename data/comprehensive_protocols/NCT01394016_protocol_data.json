PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions.\n\nDCR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who exhibit a stable disease (SD) or confirmed CR or PR relative to baseline during the study. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) for target lesions, no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions.",
