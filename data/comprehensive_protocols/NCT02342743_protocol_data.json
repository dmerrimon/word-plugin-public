They are required during baseline to have ≥15 headache days with each day consisting of ≥4 hours of continuous headache and with ≥50% of days being migraine or probable migraine days; and ≥4 distinct headache episodes, each lasting ≥4 hours.\n\nBoth patients with or without acute medication overuse (medication overuse headache - MOH) will be recruited\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Women: Pregnant, lactating or \\<6 months post partum\n2. For patients already on treatment with medications in the following classes: antihypertensives, antidepressants, antiepileptics, no dose change of those medications is allowed for at least 3 months before start of baseline and during the entire study period.\n3. For patients treated with Botox, no injection within 4 months before start of baseline or during the study.\n4. Diagnosis of other primary or secondary headache disorders, except of Medication Overuse Headache\n5. A Beck Depression Inventory score of \\>24 at baseline\n6. Psychiatric disorders that could have interfered with study participation\n7. Intolerance to supraorbital neurostimulation that makes the treatment not applicable (test of nociceptive threshold with specific Cefaly program)",
