cohort A patients will receive 300 mg BID of INCB024360; patients must not have active grade 2 autoimmune toxicities attributed to these antibodies at study entry\n  * 8 weeks after ipilimumab, other cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antibody or other immunologically active antibody\n\n    * NOTE: Patients receiving prior CTLA-4, anti-PD1 antibody or other immunologic therapy must show evidence of normal pituitary function at baseline and must not have active grade 2 autoimmune toxicities attributed to these antibodies at study entry\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1 (Karnofsky \\>= 70%)\n* Life expectancy of at least 6 months\n* Leukocytes \\>= 3,000/mcL\n* Absolute neutrophil count \\>= 1,500/mcL\n* Platelets \\>= 75,000/mcL\n* Hemoglobin \\> 9 g/dL\n* Total bilirubin \\< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (bilirubin \\< 3 × institutional upper limit of normal for Gilbert's syndrome)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase \\[SGOT\\])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase \\[SGPT\\]) up to 2.5 times upper limit normal (ULN)\n* Creatinine \\< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal OR\n* Creatinine clearance \\>= 60 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal\n* Prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR) =\\< 1.5 x institutional ULN unless patient is therapeutically anticoagulated; if on anticoagulants, PT/INR need to be within appropriate anticoagulation limits for the clinical indication; patients who are receiving anticoagulants may participate in the trial if their anticoagulation can be stopped safely for several days at the time of each biopsy\n* Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) up to 4 times ULN if thyroxine (T4) is normal\n* T4 within normal limits;
