The robotic arm's mechanical sensor continuously detects the force exerted by the patient during the test game and quantifies APP as the ratio of the patient's applied force to the total force required to complete the task (%). A higher APP indicates greater voluntary effort in movement execution. Since the test game difficulty is fixed, APP increases as the patient's motor ability improves.",

TD is calculated as the mean Euclidean distance (in mm) between discrete points along the actual movement path and the nearest corresponding points on the reference trajectory. This metric provides a measure of point-specific accuracy and precision in following the ideal movement path, with smaller TD values indicating better trajectory control.",

It is computed as the sum of absolute differences in trajectory length between the two paths (in mm). TTE reflects overall movement efficiency and smoothness, capturing the patient's ability to maintain an optimal movement path throughout the task. A lower TTE indicates better movement planning and motor control.",
