Examples of exclusionary heart failure etiologies include primary valvular disease, or infiltrative or inflammatory cardiomyopathies.\n* Cardiac surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or cardiac device implantation within the previous 3 months\n* Hospitalizations for cardiovascular causes, including heart failure, chest pain, stroke, transient ischemic attack or arrhythmias within the previous 3 months\n* Inability to perform Study visits or procedures (e.g., physical inability to perform 6MWT)\n* Unwillingness/inability to provide informed consent\n* ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, hepatic insufficiency or active liver disease\n* Recent history of acute gout\n* Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine ≥2.5mg/dL\n* Pregnant (or likely to become pregnant) women\n* Significant co-morbidity likely to cause death in the 6 month follow-up period\n* Significant active history of substance abuse within the previous 5 years\n* Current participation in another long-term clinical trial\n* History of intolerance to NR precursor compounds, including niacin or nicotinamide",
