We computed the absolute value of the Pearson's correlation for all possible pairs of time series, creating a 454x454 (N x N) connectivity matrix, which was then reduced to 10% most significant connections by subject. We estimated the FC by calculating the node strength for each parcellation, which is the weighted mean of all significant connections, from these connectivity matrices. Finally, we averaged node strength across parcellations to calculate global node strength. Higher values indicate more brain-wide FC.",
