Ratings of spoken language, language comprehension, word finding difficulty, and ability to remember test instructions are also obtained.

It measures whether the effects of active treatment are substantial enough to be detected by a skilled and experienced clinician on the basis of a clinical interview and examination. It relies on both direct examination of the patient and an interview of the study partner. A skilled and experienced clinician who is blinded to treatment assignment rates the patient on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening). It is suggested that the instrument has distinct clinical utility in assessing change in AD clinical trials.",
