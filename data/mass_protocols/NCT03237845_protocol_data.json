Less than 15 days with headache (migraine or non-migraine) per month in each of the 3 months prior to the Screening Visit and maintains this requirement during the Screening Period\n3. Patients on prophylactic migraine medication are permitted to remain on therapy provided they have been on a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to study entry.\n4. Patients with contraindications for use of triptans may be included provided they meet all other study entry criteria.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient history of HIV disease\n2. Patient history with current evidence of uncontrolled, unstable or recently diagnosed cardiovascular disease, such as ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, and cerebral ischemia. Patients with Myocardial Infarction (MI), Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS),Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), cardiac surgery, stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) during the 6 months prior to screening.\n3. Uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure), or uncontrolled diabetes (however patients can be included who have stable hypertension and/or diabetes for 3 months prior to being enrolled)\n4. Patient has a current diagnosis of major depression, other pain syndromes, psychiatric conditions (eg, schizophrenia), dementia, or significant neurological disorders (other than migraine) that, in the Investigator's opinion, might interfere with study assessments\n5. Patient has a history of gastric, or small intestinal surgery, or has a disease that causes malabsorption.\n6. The patient has a history or current evidence of any significant and/or unstable medical conditions (eg, history of congenital heart disease or arrhythmia, known suspected infection, hepatitisB or C, or cancer) that, in the investigator's opinion, would expose them to undue risk of a significant adverse event (AE) or interfere with assessments of safety or efficacy during the course ofthe trial\n7. History of, treatment for, or evidence of, alcohol or drug abuse within the past 12 months or patients who have met DSM-V criteria for any significant substance use disorder within thepast 12 months from the date of the screening visit.",
