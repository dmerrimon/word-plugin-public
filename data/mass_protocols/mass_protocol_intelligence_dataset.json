The Total Symptom Score is calculated as the mean of Pain items (Items 1-3) as a single score, then a mean of this with items 4-7). Weekly summary scores will be created by averaging the daily scores over the 7 days period prior to each visit. A weekly score will be derived only if 4 or more out of 7 days period have non-missing scores. The weekly summary score will be used in analyses. If no weekly summary score is calculable, the participant will have data considered as missing at that visit. Higher scores represent worse symptom severity. The minimum and maximum of the actual score are (0,7) for Nirogacestat and (0,10) for Placebo. A positive change from Baseline value indicated worsening of symptoms.

Patients must be \\>/= 18 years of age.\n3. • A documentation of diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphocytosis, either newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory by the treating physician and the PI in the patients chart. It must be noted that no diagnostic criteria have been established for diagnosis of HLH in adult patients as this was a hitherto poorly identified and considered to be a very rare disease in adults. We have seen an increasing number of cases of HLH at our institution over the last 2 years partly due to referrals and partly due to better understanding of the disease through discussions with our collaborators Dr Kenneth McClain and Dr Carl Allen at TCH (experts in pediatric HLH). Adult HLH seems to occur more frequently post malignancy and has a more fulminant course than pediatric HLH.\n4. Continued from No. 3: The diagnostic criteria that have been traditionally used for children (HLH 1991 and HLH 2004) may not adequately diagnose HLH in adults. This is the first adult HLH protocol in the country. In the absence of standard diagnostic guidelines if the patient's symptoms are highly suspicious for HLH and after an adequate work-up to rule out alternate potential alternate etiologies is performed we will treat the patient for HLH as missing the diagnosis is associated with high mortality. These patients will be discussed with the PI (Dr Daver) prior to enrollment in all such cases.\n5. Organ function as defined below (unless due to the HLH process): Serum creatinine \\</= 3.0 mg/dL, Total bilirubin \\</= 5.0 mg/dL. If organ dysfunction is thought to be related to the HLH process this must be clearly documented in the chart and the patients may be enrolled on study irrespective of creatinine and bilirubin levels.\n6. Women of childbearing potential must practice contraception. Females of childbearing potential: Recommendation is for 2 effective contraceptive methods during the study. Adequate forms of contraception are double barrier methods (condoms with spermicidal jelly or foam and diaphragm with spermicidal jelly or foam), oral, depo provera, or injectable contraceptives, intrauterine devices, and tubal ligation. Male patients with female partners who are of childbearing potential: Recommendation is for male and partner to use at least 2 effective contraceptive methods, as described above, prior to study entry and for at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug.\n7. Negative urine pregnancy test and/or serum pregnancy test within 7 days of initiation of therapy.\n8. Male patients with female partners who are of childbearing potential: Recommendation is for male and partner to use at least 2 effective contraceptive methods, as described above, prior to study entry and for at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Pregnant and breast feeding women\n2. Any serious/and or unstable pre-existing medical disorder (aside from malignancy exception above), psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with subject's safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study procedures\n3.

The participant must have a history of at least 10 BCCs in toto present at Baseline and/or treated within 24 months prior to screening.\n5. The participant has at Baseline a total of at least 5 previously untreated SEBs (greatest diameter 5 millimeters \\[mm\\] or greater on the face excluding the nose and periorbital skin, 9 mm or greater on non-facial areas excluding the skin below the knees), as documented clinically by the Investigator at Baseline. Untreated is define as no previous surgical or topical or intralesional drug treatment. Previous treatment with systemically administered drugs more than 6 months prior to Baseline is not considered previous treatment as long as there was no clinical evidence of resistance to oral hedgehog (HH) pathway inhibitors (such as vismodegib, patidegib, and sonidegib). Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs must not exceed a diameter of \\>2 centimeters (cm). At least one of these tumors must be appropriate for a 2 mm punch biopsy for biomarker analysis at Baseline and Week 6 visits. If a participant has 5 or more facial, excluding periorbital and nasal skin, SEBs at Baseline, non-facial SEBs will not be treatment-targeted SEBs.\n6. The participant is willing to have SEBs biopsied for biomarkers and plasma to be collected to measure drug levels as required in the protocol.\n7. The participant is willing to abstain from application of non-study topical prescription and over the counter medications to facial skin and within 5 cm of treatment targeted SEBs at other anatomical areas for the duration of the study except as prescribed by the Investigator. Moisturizers and emollients are allowable. Participants will be encouraged to use sunscreen with a sunscreen protection factor (SPF) 15 or higher at least once daily on all exposed skin sites.\n8. Female participants must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening.\n9. If the participant is a male with a female sexual partner who is of childbearing potential the couple is willing to use two effective methods of birth control during the duration of the trial and for one month after the last application of the gel. A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (that is, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months), must agree to use 2 effective methods of contraception for the duration of the study and at least 1 month after the last study drug application. The two forms of birth control authorized are defined as the use of a barrier method of contraception (condom with spermicide) in association with one of the following methods of birth control: bilateral tubal ligation; combined oral contraceptives (estrogens and progesterone) or implanted or injectable contraceptives with a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to Baseline; hormonal intra-uterine device (IUD) inserted at least 1 month prior to Baseline.\n10. The participant is willing to contact the study center after each primary skin care physician (PSCP) visit to provide the study center details of the visit and any treatment of skin tumors.\n11. The participant is willing to forego treatment of the treatment targeted baseline SEBs except when the Investigator and/or primary care giver believes that delay in treatment potentially might compromise the health of the participant.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. The participant is a woman of childbearing potential. This proscription is based on the key role of the HH pathway in embryogenesis, the known preclinical teratogenic effects of systemic cyclopamine, a naturally occurring inhibitor of SMO, and the unknown level of systemic exposure following topical application in humans. A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (that is, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).\n2. The participant has used topical products to the face or within 5 cm of a treatment targeted SEB or systemic therapies that might interfere with the evaluation of the study medication during the study. Specifically, these include the use of:\n\n   * Topical glucocorticoids 30 days prior to screening\n   * Retinoids (such as etretinate, isotretinoin, tazarotene, tretinoin, adapalene) systemically or topically or \\> 5% of an alphahydroxy acid (such as glycolic acid, lactic acid) or 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod (except as topical treatment to discrete BCCs) systemically or topically to the skin during the 6 months prior to entry.\n   * Systemic chemotherapy within one year prior to screening. (Note: field therapy with topically applied treatments can be done as long as they are not applied within 5 cm of a treatment targeted tumor).\n   * Known inhibitors of the HH signaling pathway (such as vismodegib, patidegib, and sonidegib) topically or systemically within 6 months of entry into the study.\n3. The participant has a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study drug formulation.\n4. The participant is unable or unwilling to make a good faith effort to return for all follow-up visits and tests.\n5. The participant has uncontrolled systemic disease.\n6. The participant has clinically important history of liver disease, including viral hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis.\n7. The participant has any condition or situation which in the Investigator's opinion may put the participant at significant risk, could confound the study results, or could interfere significantly with the participant's participation in the study. This includes history of other skin conditions or diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination findings, or clinical laboratory findings giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of the results of the study or render the participant at high risk from treatment complications.\n8. The participant has a history of invasive cancer within the past 5 years excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, Stage I cervical cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ of breast, or chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (Stage 0).\n9. The participant has current, recent (within 4 weeks of Baseline visit), or planned participation in an experimental drug study while enrolled in this study.\n10.

In vitro studies indicate that DM1, the cytotoxic component of T-DM1, is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5). Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with T-DM1 should be avoided due to the potential for an increase in DM1 exposure and toxicity. Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4. Lists including medications and substances known or with the potential to interact with CYP3A4 isoenzymes are provided in Appendix B.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because temozolomide is an alkylating agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with temozolomide and/or T-DM1, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with either of those agents. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n* human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are excluded because these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.\n* Patients with any other concomitant invasive malignancies are ineligible.

Stage 4 or 5 CKD, or Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of \\< 45ml/min/1.73 m2\n  2. Other kidney disease that in the opinion of the investigator would affect clearance\n* Unstable heart failure (Stage 3 or 4 heart failure)\n* Allergic reaction to metformin, fluvoxamine, or ivermectin in the past\n* Bipolar disease: individuals who report they have bipolar disorder or are taking medication for bipolar disorder (lithium, valproate, high-dose antipsychotic), unless the investigator concludes that the risk for mania is unlikely\n* Current loa loa or onchocerciasis infection\n* Typhoid, BCG, or cholera vaccination within the 14-days or 3 days after\n\nMedication Exclusions:\n\n* Cimetidine, hydroxychloroquine, insulin, sulfonylurea, dolutegravir, patiromer, ranolazine, tafenoquine.\n* Rasagiline, selegiline, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, linezolid, methadone\n* Duloxetine, methylene blue\n* Tizanidine, ramelteon, sodium picosulfate\n* Alosetron, agomelatine, bromopride, dapoxetine, tamsimelteon, thioridazine, urokinase, pimozide\n\nThe following medications may not need to be excluded when dose for that individual is considered alongside the low dose of fluvoxamine being used and other medications being used. The PI or site PI may review and decide if the patient should be excluded from the fluvoxamine arms:\n\n1. Taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or tricyclic antidepressants, unless these are at a low dose such that a study investigator concludes that a clinically significant interaction with fluvoxamine (ie either serotonin syndrome or TCA overdose) is unlikely (examples: participant takes escitalopram but only at 10mg daily; that dose plus 100mg fluvoxamine would be insufficient to cause serotonin syndrome; or, participant takes amitriptyline but only at 25mg nightly; even if fluvoxamine inhibits its metabolism, it would be an insufficient dose to cause QTc prolongation or problematic side effects). Risk Class C, monitor therapy.\n2. Individuals who take alprazolam or diazepam and are unwilling to cut the medication by 20% (rationale: fluvoxamine modestly inhibits the metabolism of these drugs). Risk Class C, monitor therapy\n3. Participants taking theophylline, clozapine, or olanzapine (drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are primarily metabolized by CYP 1A2, which is inhibited by fluvoxamine) will be reviewed with a study investigator and excluded unless the investigator concludes that the risk to the participant is low (this would be unlikely; example: participant takes clozapine only as needed and is willing to avoid it for the 14 days of the study).\n4. Patients will be advised that there is a small risk that the following substances will be affected by fluvoxamine, but that significant effects are not likely at the low dose being used: caffeine, nicotine, melatonin. Risk Class C, monitor therapy\n5. Taking warfarin-also known as Coumadin, NSAIDs, and Aspirin (rationale: increased risk of bleeding), phenytoin (rationale: fluvoxamine inhibits its metabolism), clopidogrel (rationale: fluvoxamine inhibits its metabolism from pro-drug to active drug which raises risk of cardiovascular events), and St John's wort (rationale: fluvoxamine + St John's wort are considered contraindicated because of the risk of serotonin syndrome) Risk C, monitor therapy.\n\n   * Additional COVID-19 treatments to exclude will be decided by a panel of at least 3 Co-Investigators on this study. The additional treatments to exclude will be documented and submitted to the IRB but may be implemented before formal IRB approval is complete. We take this approach because of the rapidly changing treatment landscape of COVID-19. Participation in the study does not prevent them from receiving such treatments after enrollment.",

Study treatment is expected to begin within ≤168 hours from first symptom onset.\n4. Ability to swallow pills.\n5. Documentation of confirmed active SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by a molecular or non-molecular (\"rapid\") test conducted at any clinic or laboratory that had a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification or its equivalent from a sample collected ≤96 hours prior to study entry.\n6. Was experiencing at least one of the following SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms at the time of enrollment: fever (could be subjective including feeling feverish or having chills) OR signs/symptoms of respiratory illness (including but not limited to upper respiratory congestion, loss of sense of smell or taste, sore throat OR lower respiratory illness - cough, shortness of breath).\n7. Agreed to not participate in another interventional clinical trial for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 during the study period (28 days) unless hospitalized.\n8. Agreed to not obtain investigational medications outside of the molnupiravir study.\n9. Agreed to the sampling detailed in the schedule of evaluations and to comply with study requirements including contraception requirements.\n10. A female participant was eligible to participate if she was not pregnant or breastfeeding and at least one of the following conditions applied:\n\n    * Was not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR\n    * Was a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (a low user dependency method OR a user-dependent method in combination with a barrier method), or was abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long-term and persistent basis), as described in Appendix 2 of the study protocol during the intervention period and for at least 50 days after the last dose of study intervention. The investigator evaluated the potential for contraceptive method failure (ie, noncompliance, recently initiated) in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.\n    * A WOCBP must have had a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 24 hours before the first dose of study intervention.\n    * Additional requirements for pregnancy testing during and after study intervention were provided in the study protocol.\n    * The investigator was responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy.\n    * Contraceptive use by women was to be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.\n    * Given the elevated risk of venous thrombotic events in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (Benson et al, 2020; Spratt et al, 2020), estrogen-containing contraceptives could not be started to fulfill the contraceptive requirement of this study at any time during participant's participation. If contraceptives were interrupted as standard of care management of COVID-19 patients and resumed at a later time point, such as at hospital discharge, then abstinence was practiced for the defined period of back-up contraception per the contraceptive product labeling. After this period, contraceptive use had to adhere to the guidance in Appendix 2 of the study protocol.\n11. Male participants were eligible to participate if they agreed to the following during the intervention period and for at least 100 days after the last dose of study intervention:\n\n    * Refrained from donating sperm\n\nPLUS either:\n\n* Were abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agreed to remain abstinent.\n\nOR\n\n* Had to agree to use contraception unless confirmed to be azoospermic (vasectomized or secondary to medical cause \\[Appendix 2 of the study protocol\\]) as detailed below:\n\n  * Agreed to use a male condom plus partner use of an additional contraceptive method when having penile-vaginal intercourse with a WOCBP who was not pregnant. Note: Men with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner had to agree to remain abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile-vaginal penetration.\n  * Contraceptive use by men was to be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Need for hospitalization or immediate medical attention in the clinical opinion of the study investigator.\n2. Hemoglobin \\<10 g/dL in men and \\<9 g/dL in women.\n3. Platelet count \\<100,000/ µL or received a platelet transfusion within 5 days prior to enrollment.\n4. Was on dialysis or has an estimated glomerular filtration rate \\<30 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2\n5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\>3x upper limit normal (ULN).\n6. History of or current hospitalization for COVID-19. Note: Individuals hospitalized and then discharged, even if only hospitalized for 1 day, were excluded.\n7. History of kidney disease as evidenced by estimated creatinine clearance value \\<30 mL/min.\n8. History of significant liver disease in the opinion of the site investigator or active hepatitis B or active hepatitis C. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that is advanced (CD4\\<200/mm\\^3) and/or on treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues.\n9. Use of therapeutic interventions with possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity within 30 days prior to study entry, (e.g., remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir fixed dose combination, ribavirin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and convalescent plasma), or participation in a clinical trial involving any of these drugs whether for treatment or prophylaxis.\n10. Receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination prior to study entry.\n11. Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of molnupiravir, or its formulation.\n12. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.\n13. History of recent (within the past 3 months) hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident) or major bleed.\n14. Presence of a condition, that in the opinion of the investigator, would place the subject at increased risk from study participation.",

The presence of each of the above four HRCT findings is assessed independently in three (upper, middle and lower) zones of each lung. The extent of each HRCT finding was determined by visually estimating the percentage (to the nearest 5%) of parenchymal involvement in each zone. The score for each zone was calculated by multiplying the percentage of the area by the grading scale score (i.e. 1. normal attenuation; 2. reticular abnormality; 3. traction bronchiectasis; and 4. honeycombing). The six zone scores were averaged to determine the total score for each patient. The score ranges from 100 to 400, higher values represent more fibrosis.",
