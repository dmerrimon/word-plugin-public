exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy\n* Patient has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis\n\n  * Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment\n* Patient has a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to MK-3475\n* Patient has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents; patients with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule; patients that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study; the use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the protocol principal investigator (PI) and Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN); patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study\n* Patient has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator\n* Patient has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n* Patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, interstitial lung disease, non-infectious pneumonitis, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment\n\n  * NOTE: pregnant women are excluded from this study;

appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents)\n  * Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study; in order to participate in the study, they must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of the study and during the follow-up period described above; if there is any question that a subject will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that subject should not be entered into the study\n  * Pregnancy: if a patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with MK-3475, the patient will immediately be removed from the study;

the study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn; if a male patient impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy reported and followed\n  * Subjects who are breast-feeding are not eligible for enrollment\n* Patient is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive\n\nNote: patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive may participate IF they meet the following eligibility requirements:\n\n* They must be stable on their anti-retroviral regimen, and they must be healthy from an HIV perspective\n* They must have a cluster of differentiation (CD)4 count of greater than 250 cells/mcL\n* They must not be receiving prophylactic therapy for an opportunistic infection\n\n  * Patient has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus \\[HCV\\] ribonucleic acid \\[RNA\\] \\[qualitative\\] is detected)\n* Note: a positive hepatitis B serology indicative of previous immunization (i.e., hepatitis B surface antibody \\[HBsAb\\]-positive and hepatitis B core antibody \\[HBcAb\\]-negative) or a fully resolved acute hepatitis B infection is not an exclusion criterion\n\n  * Has active non-infectious pneumonitis \\>= grade 2; or history of grade 3 non-infectious pneumonitis within the past 12 months; or any history of grade 4 non-infectious pneumonitis\n  * History of other pulmonary disease such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), (forced expiratory volume in 1 second \\[FEV1\\] \\< 60% of predicted for height and age); pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are required in patients with prolonged smoking history or symptoms of respiratory dysfunction\n  * Cardiovascular disease that meets one of the following: congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV), active angina pectoris, or recent myocardial infarction (within the last 6 months)\n  * Prior organ allograft or allogeneic transplantation, if the transplanted tissue is still in place\n  * Patient has had live vaccines within 30 days before the first dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial;
