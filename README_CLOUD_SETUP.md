# Cloud Setup for Office Online

Since Office Online requires public HTTPS URLs, here are your options:

## Option 1: Microsoft Word Desktop (Recommended)
- **Download Word** (free 30-day trial)
- **Upload manifest.xml** directly - localhost works fine
- **Full plugin functionality** without restrictions

## Option 2: Use GitHub Codespaces
1. **Push your code to GitHub**
2. **Open in Codespaces** (free tier available)
3. **Run `npm start`** - Codespaces provides public HTTPS URLs
4. **Update manifest.xml** with the Codespaces URL
5. **Upload to Office Online**

## Option 3: Quick Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
1. **Upload to Vercel** (free static hosting)
2. **Update manifest.xml** with your Vercel URL
3. **Use with Office Online**

## Current Status
- ✅ **Plugin works locally** at https://localhost:3000/taskpane.html
- ✅ **Backend integration** with your Render API
- ✅ **All functionality** complete
- ❌ **Office Online** requires public HTTPS (security restriction)

## Quick Test
1. Go to **https://localhost:3000/taskpane.html**
2. Accept SSL warning
3. Click **"Analyze Selection"** to see demo
4. Verify **backend API calls** work

Your plugin is fully functional - it's just an Office Online security limitation!
